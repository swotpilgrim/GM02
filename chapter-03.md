# Chapter 3: The Second Drowning

Jillian Torres opened the equipment rental shack at six a.m., five days after the first drowning.

The morning was soft and gray, pre-sunrise light turning the gulf into brushed silver. A thin mist hung over the water, the kind that would burn off by eight. The beach was empty except for a few gulls picking through debris at the tide line.

She unlocked the shack—really just a wooden shed painted turquoise, the color faded and peeling—and started the morning routine. Inventory the snorkel gear, check the boogie boards for damage, stack the beach chairs for rent. Boring work, but it paid for her research and kept her near the water.

Business had been slow since the drowning. Tourists were nervous. Jillian had overheard conversations at the tiki bar: *Did you hear someone died? The water isn't safe. Maybe we should go to Destin instead.*

Marcus had been different since the incident. Quieter. He'd shown up to his shifts early, stayed late, watched the water with an intensity that bordered on obsession.

Jillian carried a stack of life jackets outside and stopped.

Something was floating near the pier.

At first she thought it was debris. A log, maybe, or a chunk of Styrofoam torn from a dock. But the shape was wrong. Too solid.

A body. Face-down. Female, from the long blonde hair spreading in the water like seaweed. Wearing a bikini top and cut-off shorts.

Oh god.

Jillian dropped the life jackets and ran. Her Converse sneakers kicked up sand as she splashed into the shallows. The water was shockingly cold in the early morning. She grabbed the body—the woman—and dragged her toward shore. Deadweight. Heavy. Wrong.

"Help!" Jillian's voice cracked. "Someone help!"

The resort was too far away. No one could hear her. She pulled the woman onto the sand and rolled her over, already knowing what she'd find.

Dead. Blue lips, staring eyes, skin pale and waterlogged. Early twenties, Jillian guessed. Pretty. Or had been.

Jillian's marine biology training kicked in before the panic could. She checked for a pulse—nothing. No breathing. Pupils fixed and dilated. She'd been dead for hours, probably. Body temperature suggested she'd been in the water overnight.

"Jesus." Jillian sat back on her heels, breathing hard. Her hands were shaking. She'd dissected plenty of marine specimens in the lab, but this was different. This had been a person. Someone with a life and plans and a future.

Someone who'd drowned in calm water.

Jillian looked out at the gulf. The mist was lifting, revealing glass-smooth water. No waves. No current. Perfect conditions.

Just like five days ago.

Jillian ran back to the main building screaming for help. Carter was at the front desk and immediately called 911. Marcus sprinted to the beach, arriving out of breath and white-faced. Other staff gathered—Lisa from the restaurant kitchen, Bobby from the maintenance building, Mr. Kowalski in his bathrobe looking like he might have a heart attack.

The dead woman lay on the sand where Jillian had left her, covered with a beach towel that Marcus had grabbed. But you could still see her feet, pale and motionless, toes pointed toward the sky.

Jillian stood apart from the group, arms crossed, trying to stop shaking. Marcus approached her.

"You okay?"

"Define okay." Jillian's voice came out sharper than she intended. "Sorry. No. I'm not okay. I just found a dead body."

"Her name was Bethany Cross," Lisa said quietly, joining them. She looked like she might cry. "She was staying in Room 14. Spring break group from Alabama. They've been here since Monday. She came to the restaurant for breakfast every morning. Always ordered scrambled eggs, no toast. Nice girl. Tipped well." Lisa's voice trembled. "She was only twenty-one."

The sheriff's car pulled into the parking lot, lights flashing. Same deputy as last time—Collins. He looked less sympathetic today, more annoyed. This was becoming a pattern, and patterns meant problems.

"All right, everyone back." Collins approached the body, knelt down, lifted the towel. His expression didn't change, but Jillian saw him tense. "You," he pointed at Jillian. "You found her?"

"Yes, sir. Opening the equipment shack. Saw her floating near the pier."

"You pulled her out?"

"Yes. Checked for vitals. Already dead."

Collins stood. "Anyone see what happened last night?"

Carter spoke up: "Her friends said she went for a beach walk around nine. Never came back."

"Beach walk at night. Stupid." Collins wrote in his notebook. "Gulf's dangerous after dark."

"The gulf is calm," Marcus said flatly. "Perfect swimming conditions."

"Still dangerous. Could've panicked." Collins closed his notebook. "Probably another accidental drowning."

"Two drownings in five days," Marcus said. "That's not normal."

"People drown, son. Happens all the time." Collins's eyes narrowed. "Just because you're the lifeguard doesn't mean you can save everyone."

Jillian touched Marcus's arm. "Let it go."

The deputy called for the coroner. The crowd dispersed slowly. Kowalski pulled Carter aside, voice urgent.

Jillian stayed on the beach with Marcus, both of them staring at the shape under the towel.

"You saw her," Jillian said. "When they covered the first guy. The businessman. You said there was bruising on his ankles."

Marcus nodded slowly.

"Did you look at this one?"

"Not yet. Collins was watching."

"Well, he's not watching now."

They exchanged a look. This was probably illegal, definitely unethical. But Jillian's scientific curiosity was stronger than her respect for protocol. And Marcus's obsessive need to understand what was happening outweighed his better judgment.

Marcus lifted the towel.

Bethany Cross stared at nothing with clouded eyes. Her blonde hair was tangled with seaweed and sand. Lips blue. Skin pale and wrinkled from hours in the water.

And on her ankles—both ankles—dark oval bruises.

"Oh my god," Jillian breathed. She knelt down, examining them without touching. "Those are hand marks. Look at the spacing—thumb on one side, fingers on the other. Someone grabbed her."

"Same as the first victim." Marcus's jaw was tight. "Exact same pattern."

"This can't be coincidence."

"It's not." Marcus covered the body again, his movements gentle despite the circumstances. "Someone is drowning people. Deliberately."

Jillian's mind raced, trying to fit the facts into a logical framework. "But how? The water's been clear. No storms, no unusual currents. And both victims were capable swimmers, according to people who knew them. How does someone drown two people in calm water without being seen?"

"I don't know. But those marks don't lie."

The coroner's van pulled into the parking lot. End of their investigation window. Marcus and Jillian stood and walked back toward the resort, leaving the body for the professionals.

"We should tell the deputy," Jillian said. "Show him the bruising."

"He won't listen. He saw the same marks on the first victim and dismissed them as debris impact."

"Then we go over his head. County sheriff, state police, someone who'll take this seriously."

Marcus shook his head. "And tell them what? Two drownings in five days, we have suspicions? They'll say the same thing Collins did—people drown. Without evidence of actual foul play, without a suspect or motive, they'll call us paranoid."

"So what do we do?"

"I don't know." Marcus's frustration was evident in every line of his body. "But I'm not going to sit back and wait for a third person to die."

That evening, the staff gathered at the tiki bar without organizing it. Some things just happened when people were scared.

Bobby nursed a beer in the corner. Carter and Jillian drank rum and Cokes. Lisa stared at her Sprite. Marcus arrived last, looking tired.

"Kowalski's freaking out," Carter said. "Three families checked out today. Six more leaving tomorrow."

"Two people died," Lisa said softly. "Maybe that's more important."

Bobby spoke up, voice rough. "My grandmother used to tell stories. About La Llorona del Golfo." He pronounced it carefully. "The Weeping Woman of the Gulf."

Everyone turned to look at him.

"Local legend. A woman drowned herself in 1957. Husband came back from war changed, mean. She couldn't take it. Walked into the water."

"The legend says she weeps for disrespect to the sacred waters. When tourists treat the gulf badly—litter, pollute—she pulls them under. Drowns them."

"That's fascinating folklore," Jillian said. "Environmental anxiety projected onto geographic features—"

"You don't believe it," Bobby interrupted.

"I don't believe in ghosts."

Bobby shrugged. "My grandmother did. Said drownings happened too often here. Two, three a summer. Going back decades. Always tourists. Always calm water. Always accidents."

"That's thirty to forty deaths over twenty years," Jillian said. "That's a pattern."

"Or exaggerated folklore," Carter countered.

"Maybe the stories are true," Lisa said quietly. "Not literally. But maybe something is wrong here. Something in the water."

"Something," Marcus said, "or someone."

He pulled a Polaroid from his pocket—Tom Harris's ankles. "See the bruising? Jillian and I saw identical marks on the second victim. Grip marks. Someone grabbed both victims' ankles and held them underwater."

Lisa's hand went to her mouth. Carter looked uneasy. Bobby looked shaken.

"You're saying there's a killer. Someone drowning tourists."

"Yes."

"That's insane. How would they not be seen?"

"I don't know. But the evidence doesn't lie."

Jillian studied the photo. "Could be diving equipment. Scuba gear, stay submerged, invisible. Wait for a victim, grab their ankles."

"In chest-deep water?" Carter challenged.

"If the attacker is strong enough, victim panicked..." Jillian imagined it. Terror, water filling lungs, hands gripping ankles. "It wouldn't take long. A minute, maybe two."

"This is crazy," Carter said, unconvinced.

Marcus leaned forward. "Two people are dead. Both drowned in perfect conditions. Both have identical bruising. If there's even a chance someone is doing this deliberately, we can't ignore it."

"We should go to the police," Lisa said.

"They think it's accidental. They won't investigate based on bruising they already dismissed."

"Then what do we do?"

In the distance came a sound—wind, birds, something else. A thin cry like someone weeping.

Lisa's head snapped toward the beach. "Did you hear that?"

"Hear what?" Carter asked.

"The crying. From the water."

They listened. Jillian heard nothing but surf. Bobby stared at the gulf. Marcus looked skeptical.

"I don't hear anything," Carter said.

"It's there. La Llorona."

"It's wind," Jillian said. "Or shorebirds."

"Maybe." Lisa looked at Marcus. "But whether it's a ghost or a person, something is killing people. And it's going to happen again."

No one argued.

They all knew she was right.
