# Chapter 10: Mapping the Pattern

The coastal map covered Bobby's workbench, edges weighted down with wrenches.

Marcus stood over it, three red pushpins in hand. One for each drowning location. The afternoon sun slanted through the shed's window. The group had assembled after lunch—everyone off shift.

"Tom Harris drowned here." Marcus pushed the first pin into the map, about three hundred yards north of the resort pier. "June 8. Midday, chest-deep water."

"Bethany Cross." Second pin, closer to shore, maybe fifty yards south of the pier. "June 12. Dusk."

"James Hendricks." Third pin, between the first two, slightly farther out. "June 15. Mid-afternoon."

The three pins formed a rough triangle. Marcus stepped back, studying the pattern.

Jillian leaned in, pulled a tourist map from her bag—the glossy kind they handed out at gas stations—and laid it beside the coastal map. "Look at the radius. All three drownings within a quarter-mile area. That's not random distribution."

Carter traced the perimeter with his finger. "Specific hunting ground. Controlled territory."

"But why this section?" Lisa asked. "The beach runs for miles. Why here?"

"Access." Jillian pulled the tourist map closer, pointed to a small square marked with a diving mask icon. "Wade's Gulf Diving. Equipment rental, lessons, charters. Right here." She tapped a spot on the main road, maybe two hundred yards from the beach. "This section of beach is the closest access point to his shop."

Marcus felt his pulse quicken. "Show me the rental logs."

Carter pulled a folded photocopy from his pocket. "I went to Wade's yesterday. Teenager working the counter, barely eighteen, completely bored. Told him I was doing a photography project on Gulf Coast tourism. He showed me the rental log like it was nothing. I photocopied three days while he was in the bathroom."

He spread the pages across the map. Rental records: Name, Date, Equipment Type, Return Time.

Marcus scanned the entries, and there it was.

*Thomas Harris - June 7 - Snorkel Set (Adult) - Returned 6/8*

*Bethany Cross - June 11 - Mask/Fins - Returned 6/12*

*James Hendricks - June 14 - Snorkel Set (Adult) - Not Returned*

"Jesus," Jillian breathed. "All three rented from Wade within twenty-four hours of death."

"Not just rented," Marcus said. "Look at the return dates. Tom Harris rented on the seventh, drowned on the eighth. Never returned the equipment. Bethany Cross, same pattern. Hendricks rented on the fourteenth, drowned the fifteenth, equipment never came back."

"Because they died wearing it," Carter said quietly.

Lisa covered her mouth. "That's how he picks them. He watches who rents equipment. Follows them to the beach."

Bobby had been silent, standing apart. Now he spoke, voice tight. "You think Cyrus is killing people."

It wasn't a question. It was an accusation.

"The evidence points that way," Marcus said.

"What evidence? Three people rented snorkel gear and drowned? That's coincidence. Cyrus runs the biggest dive shop in Emerald Bay. Hundreds rent from him every month."

"But not hundreds drown," Jillian said gently. "And not all with the same bruising pattern. And not all from this exact section of beach."

Bobby's jaw was clenched. "Cyrus Wade is a good man. He taught half the town to dive. He volunteers at the marine sanctuary. He runs safety classes for free. You're accusing him of serial murder based on what—proximity and rental receipts?"

"Based on pattern," Marcus said. "Geographic pattern, temporal pattern, victim selection. All three victims interacted with the same person, rented from the same business, died in the same area. That's not random."

"It's not proof either."

"No. But it's enough to investigate."

Bobby turned away, hands gripping the back of his head. His shoulders were tight with tension. The shed was quiet except for the hum of fluorescent lights and distant lawn mowers.

"Cyrus taught me to dive," Bobby said finally, voice low. "Summer I turned twelve. My dad was gone, Mom was working double shifts, I was getting in trouble. Cyrus took me on. No charge. Taught me respect for the water, responsibility, discipline. He's been a fixture in this town for twenty years. Everyone knows him. Everyone trusts him."

"That's what makes him effective," Jillian said, not unkindly. "If the killer is local, he needs community trust. Needs to be invisible. A beloved dive shop owner who helps kids and volunteers—that's perfect cover."

Bobby turned back, face pained. "You don't know him."

"Neither do you," Carter said. "Not really. None of us know what people are capable of in private."

"I know Cyrus wouldn't hurt anyone."

"Then help us prove it," Marcus said. "If we investigate and he's innocent, you were right. But if we don't investigate and he kills again..." He let the implication hang.

Bobby stared at the map, at the three red pins marking death. His expression shifted—anger to confusion to reluctant acceptance. "What do you want to do?"

Marcus had been thinking about this. "I visit the shop tomorrow. Rent equipment. Get a feel for him. See how he operates, what he asks, if he shows particular interest in where people plan to dive."

"And if he does?"

"Then we watch him. Surveillance. See if he follows customers to the beach."

"I'll help," Jillian said. "I can set up on the pier with binoculars, pretend to be birdwatching."

"I'll watch the shop," Carter added. "Sit at the diner across the street, monitor who comes and goes."

Lisa looked at Bobby. "And you?"

Bobby was quiet a long moment. "I know his patterns. His schedule. When he takes lunch, when he closes shop, which boats he charters. If we're doing this, you'll need that information."

"Are you sure?" Marcus asked.

"No. But..." Bobby gestured at the map. "You're right. The pattern's there. And if there's even a chance..." He didn't finish the sentence.

Marcus understood. If there was even a chance Cyrus Wade was drowning people, they had to know. Even if it meant destroying Bobby's image of a man who'd been a mentor, a father figure, a trusted community fixture.

That was the cost of truth sometimes. And they were already too deep to turn back.

"Tomorrow's the sixteenth," Jillian said, checking her notes. "Based on the pattern—deaths on June 8, 12, and 15—we calculated the next one might be June 18. That gives us two days."

"If the pattern holds," Carter added.

"If the killer doesn't escalate," Marcus said. "Three deaths in seven days is already fast. He might accelerate."

Lisa wrapped her arms around herself. "So we watch Cyrus tomorrow. What if he targets someone while we're watching?"

"Then we intervene. Stop him in the act if we have to."

"And if he realizes we're watching him?"

"Then he gets spooked and stops. Which means no more deaths." Marcus looked around the group. "Either way, we disrupt his pattern. Make it harder for him to operate."

Bobby pulled out a notebook, started writing. "Cyrus opens the shop at eight a.m. Takes lunch around noon, usually at Rosie's Diner down the block. Closes at six p.m. most days, later if he has evening charters. He lives above the shop—apartment on the second floor. Has a boat docked at the marina, uses it for diving charters and personal use."

"Does he dive regularly?" Jillian asked.

"Every day. Morning or evening, depending on business. Says it clears his head." Bobby's voice was mechanical now, detached. Providing intelligence on a target rather than talking about a mentor.

Marcus felt a pang of sympathy but pushed it aside. This was necessary.

"We need to know his diving spots," Marcus said. "If he's approaching victims underwater, he's using specific locations. Probably near the drowning zone."

"There's a reef shelf about sixty yards offshore," Bobby said. "Drops from twelve feet to thirty feet, lots of cover. Cyrus dives there often. Says it's the best marine life."

"Close enough to observe the beach," Jillian noted. "Close enough to identify targets."

The pieces were fitting together. Marcus could see it—Cyrus Wade diving the reef, watching beachgoers, identifying victims who'd rented his equipment. Following them. Waiting for the right moment. Grabbing ankles, pulling down, holding until the struggling stopped.

All while hidden by the myth of La Llorona, protected by community trust, operating in plain sight.

"Tomorrow," Marcus said. "I'll rent equipment around nine. You all take positions—Jillian on the pier, Carter at the diner, Bobby wherever gives you best view. We watch, document, gather evidence."

"And if we see him go after someone?" Lisa asked.

"We stop him. By force if necessary."

Carter raised an eyebrow. "You're talking about physically confronting a man who's drowned three people. He's strong, skilled, and probably desperate if he's escalating."

"Then we make sure we're stronger. And smarter." Marcus looked at each of them in turn. "This is it. This is when we go from collecting evidence to active intervention. Everyone needs to be clear—this could get dangerous. If anyone wants out, now's the time."

Nobody moved.

"Okay then." Marcus pulled the pins from the map, pocketed them. "We reconvene tomorrow morning, seven a.m., go over positions and protocols. Everyone bring cameras, notepads, anything useful for documentation. And stay alert. If Cyrus Wade is our killer, he's been doing this for decades. He's smart, careful, and knows these waters better than we ever will."

As the group filed out, Bobby lingered. He stood over the map, staring at the spot marking Wade's dive shop.

"You doing okay?" Marcus asked.

"No." Bobby's voice was hollow. "If Cyrus is doing this, it means I've known a serial killer my entire life. Learned from him. Trusted him. What does that say about my judgment?"

"It says you're human. People hide what they are. Even from people close to them."

"He taught me to respect the gulf. To see it as sacred. To protect it." Bobby looked up, eyes wet. "What if he's been killing in the name of that protection? What if everything he taught me was... twisted?"

Marcus didn't have an answer that would make it better.

"We'll find out tomorrow," he said finally. "One way or another, we'll know."

Bobby nodded and walked out into the fading afternoon light.

Marcus stayed behind, studying the map. Three red pin holes marked where lives had ended. Tomorrow he'd walk into Wade's Gulf Diving and look the man in the eye. Smile, ask questions, rent equipment. Play the role of oblivious tourist.

And the whole time, he'd be searching for signs. Tells. Proof that the man behind the counter was a killer.

The sun was setting when Marcus finally locked up the shed. The gulf stretched out before him, orange and gold in the dying light. Beautiful. Deadly. Full of secrets.

And somewhere out there, Cyrus Wade was planning his next kill.

Unless Marcus and his friends stopped him first.
