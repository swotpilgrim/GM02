# Chapter 15: Bobby's Knowledge

Bobby sat alone in the maintenance shed after everyone left, staring at the timeline spread across the workbench. Twenty-three drownings. Twenty years. All in his hometown.

All while he'd been learning to dive from the man responsible.

The door opened. Lisa entered quietly, closed it behind her.

"Thought you might still be here," she said.

Bobby didn't look up. "I should have known."

"You couldn't have—"

"Everyone knew." His voice was hollow. "Not consciously maybe, but we knew. My grandmother knew. Your great-grandmother knew. The whole town knew something was wrong with Cyrus, wrong with the drownings, wrong with all of it. We just didn't want to say it out loud."

Lisa sat beside him. "Tell me."

Bobby was quiet for a long moment. Then he began.

"My grandmother—the one who kept the drowning lists—she used to tell stories about Cyrus. After Caroline died in 1957, he changed. Started going to the beach late at night, talking to the water. People would see him on his knees in the sand, having full conversations with the waves like someone was answering back."

"He was grieving," Lisa said gently.

"That's what everyone said. Poor Cyrus, lost his young wife, grief drove him a little strange. Some folks thought he was touched by God. Said he had a special connection to the gulf, could hear things others couldn't. Said he was blessed." Bobby's hands clenched. "Others thought he'd gone mad. But mad or blessed, everyone agreed he was harmless. Just an eccentric old Navy vet who talked to the water."

"When did you first see it?" Lisa asked. "The talking to the water?"

Bobby closed his eyes, remembering.

"I was eleven. Summer of 1968. Couldn't sleep—heat, no AC, you know how it is. Must've been midnight. I walked to the beach to cool off."

The memory was vivid even now, eleven years later. The beach deserted. Moonlight painting the water silver. And there, at the waterline, a figure on his knees.

"Cyrus was in the shallows. Waves lapping at his thighs. He was talking. Not to himself—to the water. Having a full conversation. Asking questions, pausing like he was listening to answers, responding. I heard him say Caroline's name. Heard him say things like 'I understand' and 'Yes, she deserves it' and 'I'll make sure.'"

Lisa's eyes widened. "He was planning a drowning."

"Maybe. I didn't know that then. I thought he was just talking to his dead wife. Which was weird, but grief is weird. I started to leave—didn't want to interrupt something private. But he saw me. Turned and looked right at me."

Bobby remembered those pale blue eyes in the moonlight. The smile that didn't reach them.

"I thought he'd be embarrassed. Caught doing something strange. But he just smiled and said: 'She speaks to those who listen, boy. The gulf has a voice. You'll hear it someday if you're worthy.' Then he went back to his conversation like I wasn't there. I ran home. Didn't tell anyone. Didn't know what to tell."

"That must have been terrifying."

"It was. But it was also... I don't know. Part of living here. Cyrus was strange. Everyone knew it. But he was also kind. He taught kids to dive for free. He fixed boats, helped with house repairs, volunteered at the marine sanctuary. He was part of the community. And we forgave the strangeness because of the kindness."

Bobby stood, paced the small shed.

"The drownings were the same way. Part of living here. Emerald Bay has always had high drowning rates—everyone knows that. Ask anyone local, they'll tell you: 'Oh yeah, the gulf claims people. Happens every summer. Tourists don't respect the water, don't know the currents, get careless.' We had explanations. Rationalizations."

"How many?" Lisa asked quietly.

"I looked it up once. Sophomore year of high school, history project. Compared Emerald Bay drowning statistics to similar towns along the Gulf Coast. Panama City, Gulf Shores, Destin—all comparable size, comparable tourism. They average two to four accidental drownings per year. Emerald Bay averages seven to ten."

"Almost triple."

"Yeah. And when I presented that in class, my teacher—Mr. Morrison, lived here his whole life—he said: 'Well Bobby, that's because our beaches attract more tourists. More people in the water means more accidents. Statistics.' Everyone nodded. Made sense. We moved on."

Bobby pulled out a notebook from his back pocket, opened to a page of handwritten numbers.

"But I kept tracking. Called it morbid curiosity. Last ten years: eighty-three drownings in Emerald Bay and immediate vicinity. Most ruled accidental. A few investigated but charges never filed. None connected. None treated as suspicious despite identical circumstances."

He showed Lisa the numbers. Years, victim counts, brief notes.

"1969: nine drownings. 1970: six. 1971: eleven—that was a bad year, lots of spring breakers. 1972: seven. Every single year, more than any comparable town. Every single year, everyone shrugged and said tourists don't respect the water."

"And Cyrus was here the whole time," Lisa said.

"Teaching diving. Running his shop. Discovering bodies—God, he discovered so many bodies. Always the helpful citizen. Always cooperative with police. Always had explanations: 'The victim seemed intoxicated,' or 'I warned them about the currents,' or 'They rented equipment but refused my safety advice.'" Bobby's voice broke. "He was hiding in plain sight. And we let him because investigating meant admitting our town had a serial killer. Meant scaring away tourists. Meant acknowledging the man everyone trusted was a monster."

Lisa stood, put her hand on his shoulder. "That's not your fault. You were a kid. The adults should have—"

"Should have what? Investigated? They did, sort of. Deputies came, wrote reports, ruled accidental, moved on. The system worked exactly as designed—protecting tourism, protecting community reputation, protecting Cyrus."

"But you know now," Lisa said firmly. "And you're doing something about it. That's what matters."

Bobby looked at her. "Your grandmother. Marie. She was one of the early ones. If I'd spoken up about seeing Cyrus that night on the beach, if I'd told someone how weird he was, maybe—"

"You were eleven. It's not your responsibility."

"Then whose is it? Because twenty-three people are dead, Lisa. Twenty-three families destroyed. My grandmother knew. Your great-grandmother knew. Half the town suspected. And nobody did anything."

The shed was quiet except for the distant sound of waves. Outside, the resort was winding down for the night. Normal people doing normal things, unaware that the beach they swam in every summer was a hunting ground.

"I used to admire Cyrus," Bobby said quietly. "He gave me my first dive knife. Taught me to navigate by compass underwater. Showed me the reef formations, the best spots for fish, where the currents were tricky. He was patient. Kind. Treated me like I mattered. My dad was gone, and Cyrus..." He trailed off.

"Filled that role," Lisa finished.

"Yeah. And now I find out he's been drowning people my entire life. How do I reconcile that? How do I process that the man who taught me to respect the water was using that water to kill?"

Lisa took both his hands. "You process it by stopping him. You take everything he taught you—the diving skills, the knowledge of these waters, the understanding of underwater terrain—and you use it against him. You help Marcus and the others catch him. You make sure no one else dies."

Bobby met her eyes. She was right. The guilt, the betrayal, the horror—all of it was useless unless channeled into action.

"I know things about Cyrus nobody else does," Bobby said slowly. "His patterns. His habits. Where he dives, when he dives, how he thinks. I know which beaches he watches, which tourists he targets, how he moves underwater. If we're going to catch him, you need me."

"We do need you. But Bobby—are you sure? This is your mentor. Your... almost father figure. Taking him down will hurt."

"It already hurts. And he's not my father figure. He's a serial killer who manipulated a lonely kid into trusting him. That's what predators do—find vulnerabilities and exploit them." Bobby's voice hardened. "He taught me to dive because it gave him cover. Gave him access. Made him look trustworthy. I was useful to him, not important to him. And I'm done being useful to monsters."

Lisa smiled sadly. "When did you get so clear-headed?"

"About thirty seconds ago. Before that I was spiraling in guilt and self-pity. But you're right—what matters is stopping him. Not wallowing in what we should have known."

They stood together in the shed, two locals whose hometown had hidden something monstrous, two young people carrying the weight of community complicity.

"My great-grandmother heard the crying the night Marie died," Lisa said quietly. "She swore until her death that she heard a woman weeping from the gulf. La Llorona. The legend that covered up the murders."

"Cyrus probably started that legend," Bobby said. "Or encouraged it. Perfect camouflage. Everyone attributes the drownings to a ghost, nobody looks for a human killer."

"You think he's killed more than twenty-three?"

"I think twenty-three is what Jillian found in a few hours of research. A full investigation? Could be double that. Triple. Could be fifty, sixty people over twenty years. Could be one hundred. We'll never know the real number because most bodies weren't examined closely, most deaths weren't investigated properly, most evidence was destroyed or ignored."

The weight of that settled over them. One hundred lives. One hundred families. All sacrificed to preserve tourism and community reputation.

"Tomorrow we end it," Bobby said. "Whatever it takes. I don't care if Cyrus taught me to dive. I don't care if he was kind to me as a kid. He's a serial killer who's operated for two decades while everyone looked away. That stops now."

"Tomorrow," Lisa agreed.

They left the shed together, walking toward the resort under a sky full of stars. The gulf whispered against the shore, eternal and patient. How many secrets did it hold? How many bodies had it carried? How many victims had it claimed—not by choice, but because a man had used it as his weapon?

Bobby looked back at the dark water one last time before heading inside.

Somewhere out there, Cyrus Wade was probably diving. Communing with the ghost he'd created. Planning his next cleansing.

But his time was ending.

The locals who'd looked away were looking now.

And what they saw, they would not forgive.
