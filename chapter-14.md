# Chapter 14: Background Check

The Emerald Bay Public Library closed at eight p.m., but the librarian made an exception.

"You girls researching for school?" Mrs. Henderson asked, unlocking the microfiche room. Sixty-something, gray hair in a bun.

"Sort of," Jillian lied. "Local history project."

"Be careful with the machines. Those reels are delicate." She showed them how to load film, adjust focus, advance frames. "What years are you looking for?"

"1950s through today," Lisa said. "Newspaper archives."

Mrs. Henderson pulled out drawers of carefully organized reels, each labeled by year and publication. "Pensacola News Journal, Emerald Bay Gazette, Mobile Register. Take your pick. I'll be at the front desk if you need help."

She left them alone with decades of history compressed onto spools of film.

Jillian started with 1955. "We need Cyrus's background. When he came to Emerald Bay, when he married Caroline, when everything started."

They loaded the film, scrolled through editions. June 1955: "Local Woman Weds Navy Veteran." Wedding photo—Caroline Landry, beautiful and young, beside Cyrus Wade in dress uniform. He looked different then. Younger, hopeful, smiling.

"Caroline Landry, 19, wed Cyrus Wade, 34, decorated Navy veteran, in ceremony at Sacred Heart Church. The couple will reside in Emerald Bay where Mr. Wade plans to establish a diving equipment business."

"Fourteen-year age gap," Lisa noted. "She was just nineteen."

"And he was thirty-four, fresh from Korea, probably suffering PTSD." Jillian advanced the film. "Let's find when she died."

1957. Summer. They scrolled through June, July, August. There.

August 14, 1957. Front page of the Emerald Bay Gazette.

**"Local Woman Drowns in Calm Waters - Tragedy Strikes Young Couple"**

Jillian read aloud: "Caroline Wade, 21, drowned yesterday evening in the Gulf of Mexico under circumstances authorities describe as 'unusual and tragic.' Mrs. Wade, an experienced swimmer born and raised on these waters, was found floating face-down approximately sixty yards offshore near the municipal pier. Witnesses report calm seas, clear skies, and no indication of distress before her disappearance. Her husband, Cyrus Wade, Navy diving veteran and local business owner, discovered her body during a search conducted after she failed to return from an evening swim."

Lisa pointed to a quote further down. "Listen to this. Cyrus's statement to authorities: 'Caroline loved the gulf more than anything. She's with it now, part of it. Sometimes late at night I hear her voice in the waves. She's telling me she's home.'"

"He was already delusional," Jillian said. "Two days after her death, he's talking about hearing her voice."

They advanced through more articles. September 1957: "Wade Drowning Ruled Accidental - No Foul Play Suspected." October: small mention of Cyrus opening his dive shop despite grief. November: community fundraiser to help him through difficult time. Everyone loved him. Everyone wanted to help.

"He had community support from the beginning," Lisa said. "Perfect camouflage."

Jillian made notes, moved to the 1960s. "Let's see what else we can find."

1962: Cyrus teaching free diving classes to local kids.

1965: expansion of Wade's Gulf Diving.

1968: small article, page six.

**"Local Volunteer Dismissed from Coast Guard Auxiliary"**

Jillian read faster. "Cyrus Wade, longtime volunteer with the Coast Guard Auxiliary, has been dismissed following incident earlier this month. Sources indicate Wade refused to participate in rescue of two tourists in distress, citing belief that the individuals were 'disrespectful to the sacred waters.' Wade could not be reached for comment. Auxiliary Captain James Morrison stated: 'We appreciate Mr. Wade's years of service, but we cannot have volunteers who pick and choose which lives to save based on personal ideology.'"

"Nineteen sixty-eight," Lisa breathed. "Eleven years after Caroline died. He was already selecting who deserved to live or die."

"And the community just... dismissed him from volunteer work. No investigation. No psychiatric evaluation. Just removed him from official capacity and let him continue operating." Jillian felt anger rising. "How many people could have been saved if someone had taken this seriously?"

Lisa was already loading the next reel. 1959. "I need to find my grandmother."

They scrolled through obituaries. May. June. There.

**"Marie Thibodeaux, 34, Drowns"**

Lisa's hands shook on the advance dial. Jillian took over, reading aloud.

"Marie Thibodeaux, 34, of Emerald Bay, drowned June 12 under mysterious circumstances. Mrs. Thibodeaux, mother of infant daughter Claudette, was discovered Friday morning near the resort pier. An experienced swimmer and lifelong resident, her drowning has been ruled accidental despite lack of clear cause. Funeral services Saturday at Sacred Heart Church. She is survived by her husband, daughter, and mother Evangeline Thibodeaux."

Lisa covered her mouth. Tears streamed down her face. "June 12, 1959. Two years after Caroline died. He was already killing."

Jillian checked her notes. "Caroline died August 1957. Your grandmother died June 1959. If Cyrus killed her—and given the pattern, I think he did—he started within two years of Caroline's death. Maybe sooner. Maybe Caroline was his first victim, not his motivation."

"What do you mean?"

"What if Cyrus killed Caroline? What if she tried to leave him, or disagreed with his environmental obsession, or did something he considered disrespectful? What if her drowning wasn't an accident—it was murder? And his delusion about her being 'part of the gulf' was how he justified it to himself?"

Lisa stared at the microfiche screen, at her grandmother's obituary. "Then he's been killing for over twenty years. My grandmother was just one of dozens."

Jillian did the math. Two victims per year, conservatively. Twenty years. That was forty people. Maybe more in recent years if he was escalating. Forty families destroyed. Forty lives ended. All written off as accidents because the local authorities didn't want to investigate.

"We need to find more," Jillian said. "Every drowning in Emerald Bay from 1959 to now."

They worked for three hours, taking turns at the microfiche, building a timeline. Mrs. Henderson brought them coffee and cookies, pleased to see young people interested in local history.

By the time they finished, they had a list.

Twenty-three drownings in Emerald Bay and surrounding beaches from 1959 to 1979. All in calm water. All experienced swimmers or locals who knew the gulf. All ruled accidental. Many within days of being seen arguing with locals about littering, pollution, or disrespect to the environment.

Several specifically mentioned Cyrus Wade in police reports—he'd discovered bodies, filed initial reports, provided witness statements. Always helpful. Always cooperative. Always there.

"He's been doing this for twenty years," Lisa said quietly. "Killing people and hiding it behind community trust and local folklore. And everyone let him."

"Not everyone knew—"

"Everyone suspected. The drowning rates. The patterns. The way Cyrus talked about the gulf. My grandmother's mother knew. Bobby's grandmother kept lists. But nobody did anything because investigating would hurt tourism, would make the town look bad, would force people to confront the monster living among them."

Jillian gathered the notes, the copied articles, the timeline. "We take this to the group. Tonight. They need to see the scope."

---

Midnight. The maintenance shed. Everyone assembled.

Marcus looked exhausted. Carter too. Bobby sat apart from the group, arms crossed, face pale. Jillian spread the research across the workbench.

"Twenty-three drownings," she said without preamble. "Twenty years. All in Emerald Bay and surrounding beaches. All matching the same pattern—calm water, experienced swimmers, ruled accidental, many victims witnessed being disrespectful to the environment shortly before death."

She laid out the timeline. "Caroline Wade drowns in 1957. Cyrus begins showing delusion immediately—talks about her being 'part of the gulf,' hearing her voice. Within two years, he's killing. 1959, Lisa's grandmother Marie. Then one or two per year through the sixties and seventies. Thirty-three kills in 1968 when the Coast Guard catches him refusing to rescue people he deemed 'disrespectful.'"

"They dismissed him and did nothing else," Lisa added, voice tight. "Didn't investigate. Didn't report him to police. Just removed him from volunteer work and went on with business."

Marcus studied the timeline. "The recent escalation—three in one week—might be stress response. Maybe he knows we're investigating. Maybe his delusion is intensifying. Maybe he's trying to 'cleanse' the gulf before tourist season peaks."

"Or maybe he's just gotten more confident," Carter said. "Twenty years of killing without consequences. Why slow down?"

Bobby finally spoke. "I knew. We all knew. Not consciously, but... everyone in Emerald Bay knows the drowning rates are high. Everyone knows Cyrus is strange about the gulf. Everyone knows not to argue with him about environmental stuff because he gets intense. We knew. We just didn't want to admit what it meant."

"That's not your fault," Lisa said.

"Isn't it? I was twelve years old when he taught me to dive. I heard him talk about the gulf like she was alive, like she judged people. I saw him get angry at tourists. I knew drownings happened every summer. How did I not connect it?" Bobby's voice broke. "My grandmother kept lists of deaths. Lisa's great-grandmother knew Marie was murdered. The whole town suspected, and we all just... looked away. Because Cyrus was a war hero. Because he taught our kids to swim. Because investigating would be inconvenient."

"You were a child," Marcus said. "The adults failed. The authorities failed. But you're here now. We're all here now. And we're going to stop him."

"How?" Bobby challenged. "We have timeline, pattern, psychological profile, physical evidence. We have everything except hard proof that Cyrus Wade personally drowned anyone. His defense will be: 'I'm just an old man who talks strangely and happens to live near a beach with high drowning rates.' How do we prove intent?"

The shed was silent. The evidence was overwhelming—but Bobby was right. Circumstantial didn't equal prosecutable.

"We catch him," Jillian said quietly. "In the act. We stake out the beach, watch him, wait for him to select a target. Document it. Intervene before he kills. Create irrefutable proof."

"Use someone as bait," Carter said. "Someone he'd target. Someone disrespectful."

"That's insane," Lisa protested. "We're talking about putting someone in danger to lure a serial killer."

"We're talking about stopping twenty years of murder," Marcus countered. "And if we don't, there'll be a fourth victim. And a fifth. And however many more until Cyrus dies of old age or someone finally takes this seriously."

They looked at each other. Five young people in a maintenance shed, planning to catch a killer the system had protected for two decades.

"Tomorrow," Marcus said. "We plan the trap. We set the bait. We end this."

"Tomorrow," they agreed.

And outside, the gulf rolled against the shore, patient and dark, carrying secrets and the weight of twenty-three souls who'd drowned in her embrace.

Twenty-three that they knew of.

How many more were there, lost to history, written off as accidents, mourned but never avenged?

The dead deserved better.

And tomorrow, they'd start getting it.
