# Chapter 1: Arrival

The Sandpiper Beach Resort looked smaller than Marcus remembered.

He eased his '72 Chevy Nova into the parking lot, the engine ticking as it cooled under the late afternoon sun. The dashboard thermometer read ninety-two degrees, and the humidity made the air thick enough to chew. Through the windshield, past the cracked vinyl dash and the Saint Christopher medal hanging from the rearview mirror, Marcus studied the place that would be home for the next three months.

The resort was arranged in a horseshoe—two-story motel buildings painted in faded pastels that probably looked cheerful in the early sixties but now just looked tired. Turquoise paint peeled from window frames. The courtyard pool's tiles were cracked, visible even from here. A faded sign proclaimed "Welcome to Paradise!" with an optimism the property couldn't quite support anymore.

Marcus popped the 8-track out of the deck—Boston's *More Than a Feeling* had been looping for the last hour of I-10—and climbed out of the car. The heat hit him like a physical thing. Salt air mixed with the smell of sunscreen and something frying from the resort restaurant. He'd forgotten how the Gulf Coast smelled: fish and brine and humidity, underlaid with that particular Florida panhandle scent of pine trees baking in relentless sun.

Third summer. He was back for his third summer.

The parking lot was nearly empty. Half a dozen cars, maybe, spread across spaces that could hold fifty. For early June, that was wrong. Last year the place had been packed by Memorial Day. Marcus grabbed his duffel from the trunk and headed toward the main building, Converse sneakers scuffing on asphalt that shimmered with heat.

The lobby was blessedly cool, if a bit musty. Dark wood paneling, rattan furniture with floral cushions, a slowly rotating ceiling fan that had probably been installed when Eisenhower was president. Behind the front desk sat Carter Whitmore, exactly where Marcus had left him last August—though the polo shirt was new, powder blue instead of last year's yellow.

"Well, well." Carter looked up from a paperback—*The Dead Zone*, brand new from the looks of it. "The prodigal lifeguard returns."

Marcus grinned despite himself. "Couldn't stay away from the glamour."

"Obviously." Carter stood, extending a hand across the desk. His grip was firm, his Rolex catching the light. Some things never changed—Carter was still the most overdressed person at a beach resort, still had that prep-school confidence that money bought. "How was the drive from Tampa?"

"Long. Hot. The AC gave up somewhere around Tallahassee." Marcus wiped sweat from his forehead. "Place looks quiet."

Something flickered across Carter's face. Not quite worry—Carter didn't do worry. Unease, maybe. "Yeah, it's been a weird season so far. We had some... trouble. Earlier in May."

"What kind of trouble?"

"Nothing." Carter waved it away too quickly. "Just, you know. Slow start. Weather's been off, I guess. Kowalski's been in a mood about it."

Marcus waited, but Carter had already turned to the pegboard behind him, unhooking a key attached to a plastic tag shaped like a surfboard. Room 24. Same room as last year.

"You'll want to get settled before dinner," Carter said, handing over the key. "We've got a couple new hires you should meet. Equipment rental girl seems cool—marine biology student, Florida State. Name's Jillian. And there's a new waitress in the restaurant, Lisa. Local girl."

"Bobby still on maintenance?"

"Unfortunately." Carter's smile didn't quite reach his eyes. "He's around somewhere. Probably avoiding actual work."

The dynamic between Carter and Bobby had been tense last summer—working-class local versus trust-fund college boy—but they'd mostly kept it civil. Mostly.

"I'll drop my stuff and head to the tower," Marcus said. "Check the setup before tomorrow."

"Tower's good. Bobby actually did his job for once." Carter sat back down, picked up his book. Then, as Marcus turned to go: "Hey, Marcus? Good to have you back, man. Really."

There was something in Carter's voice that made Marcus pause. But when he looked back, Carter was already reading again, apparently absorbed in Stephen King's latest. Marcus headed for his room.

---

Room 24 smelled like Pine-Sol and old air conditioning. Marcus dropped his duffel on the bed and changed into his lifeguard trunks and a tank top. He caught his reflection in the mirror: lean from a spring of swimming laps, tan already starting, shaggy brown hair that would bleach lighter by July. The scar on his left shoulder was pale against new tan.

Twenty-two years old, third summer watching the same beach. The money was good, and he liked the work. Liked the responsibility. Liked knowing he was the one standing between tourists and the gulf's indifference.

He grabbed his aviator sunglasses and headed back out into the heat.

The beach stretched out before him. White sand, calm turquoise water shading to deeper blue. The lifeguard tower stood exactly where he'd left it, freshly painted red and white. Someone—probably Bobby—had actually maintained it over the winter.

Marcus climbed up and tested the chair. Solid. The whistle was still there on its lanyard, first aid kit stocked. He sat down, feet propped on the railing, and looked out at the gulf.

The water was calm as glass, barely any surf. Locals called it the "bathtub"—warm and gentle. Perfect swimming conditions.

But the beach was empty.

A family down by the pier, a couple at the waterline. For late afternoon in early June, it should have been crowded. Umbrellas and towels, transistor radios playing Top 40, the smell of Coppertone and hotdogs.

Instead, the beach felt abandoned.

Marcus told himself it was nothing. Slow start, like Carter said. Weather had been off. Economy was weird—gas prices, inflation, people tightening belts. It didn't mean anything.

Still. Something felt wrong.

He shook it off and climbed back down. The tiki bar was just opening for happy hour, and he figured he might as well see who else was around. The bar sat between the pool and the beach, a thatched-roof structure that had seen better decades. A chalkboard advertised "2-for-1 Rum Runners!" in enthusiastic cursive.

Carter was already there, changed out of his work polo into a different polo—this one coral pink. Jillian must be the woman next to him: compact build, dark curly hair in a messy bun, wearing cut-off shorts and a Florida State t-shirt. She was explaining something with her hands, animated, while Carter listened with the expression of someone trying to keep up.

"—because the symbiotic relationship between the coral and the zooxanthellae is actually—oh, hey." Jillian turned as Marcus approached, offering a quick smile. "You must be Marcus. Carter said you were coming in today."

"Marine biology?" Marcus guessed.

"Guilty. Jillian Torres." She shook his hand firmly. "I'm running the equipment rental shack this summer. You know, snorkel gear, boogie boards, beach chairs. Very scientific."

"Beats my thesis research," she added. "Which is currently going nowhere because my advisor is useless."

Carter caught the bartender's attention. "Beer for Marcus. Whatever's on tap and cold."

The bartender—new guy, Marcus didn't recognize him—pulled a Budweiser and slid it across. Marcus took a long drink, the cold cutting through the humidity-thick air. A portable radio behind the bar was playing Blondie's *Heart of Glass*, staticky but cheerful.

"So what brings you to paradise?" Marcus asked Jillian.

"Money, mostly." She shrugged. "And field research, if I can swing it. The gulf ecosystem out here is pretty fascinating. Less developed than the Atlantic coast, fewer pollutants. I want to document some of the endemic species before—"

"Before tourists ruin it?" The voice came from behind them, flat and unfriendly.

Bobby Doucet leaned against one of the tiki bar's support posts, arms crossed. He looked exactly the same as last summer: wiry, sun-weathered, perpetual stubble, tank top and cut-off shorts that had seen better years. The tattoo on his forearm—a crude fish hook, self-done—was faded but still visible.

"Bobby." Marcus kept his voice neutral. "Good to see you."

"Yeah." Bobby's eyes flicked to Jillian, then back to Marcus. "Tower's all set. Did the maintenance like I was told."

"Looks great. Thanks."

An uncomfortable silence stretched. Carter examined his beer bottle with sudden interest. Jillian looked between them, clearly picking up on the tension.

"Lisa!" Carter called out, apparently grateful for the interruption. "Come meet Marcus!"

The young woman approaching from the direction of the restaurant was petite, with long straight brown hair and wide dark eyes. She wore the resort's waitress uniform—coral polo shirt, white shorts—and moved with the careful quiet of someone used to not drawing attention.

"Lisa Thibodeaux," she said softly, shaking Marcus's hand. Her grip was gentle. "Welcome back."

"You're local?" Marcus asked.

"Born here. Lived here my whole life." She glanced at Bobby, some understanding passing between them—the only two locals in a group of outsiders. "My grandmother used to work here, actually. Back in the fifties."

"Family business," Carter said cheerfully, trying to lighten the mood. "Lisa knows everything about Emerald Bay. She's been telling me about all the secret spots."

"Not much secret about a town with two hundred people," Lisa said, but she smiled a little. "But yeah. If you need to know where to get the best bait, or which roads flood when it rains, I'm your girl."

They talked for a while longer, easy conversation about nothing important. Carter told a story about a guest who'd complained that the ocean was "too salty." Jillian explained the difference between gulf and Atlantic ecosystems. Lisa mentioned that the Piggly Wiggly in town had fresh key lime pie on Thursdays. Bobby mostly listened, occasionally interjecting something sarcastic, nursing a beer that he made last.

Marcus found himself relaxing. This was familiar—the summer crew getting to know each other, the casual rhythm of beach resort life. Different faces, same pattern. Three months of sun and salt water and tourists who didn't know how to swim. Three months of saving money for next semester.

Three months of watching the water.

As the sun dropped toward the horizon, painting the gulf in shades of orange and pink, Marcus felt that familiar summer optimism settling in. The empty beach was just a slow start. The wrongness he'd sensed was just paranoia. Everything would be fine.

He was wrong, of course.

But he wouldn't know that until three days later, when the first body washed up.

Out on the water, invisible in the gathering dark, a boat bobbed gently in the calm gulf. A man stood on the deck with binoculars, watching the group at the tiki bar. Watching the new lifeguard with the aviator sunglasses. Watching the college kids with their easy laughter and their disrespect.

Cyrus Wade lowered the binoculars and began coiling rope with practiced, methodical movements. The gulf was calm tonight. Sacred. Pure.

For now.
