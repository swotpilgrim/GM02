# Chapter 7: Lisa's Story

Lisa's mobile home was three miles inland, in a park called Whispering Pines that had no pines.

The group arrived in two vehicles—Carter's Trans Am and Bobby's rusted pickup. Evening was settling in, the heat finally breaking.

Lisa lived in a single-wide from the early sixties, pale blue with white trim, chain-link fence around a small yard. Flower pots lined the steps. A vegetable garden in one corner, tomato plants heavy with fruit.

"My grandmother's inside," Lisa said. "She doesn't get around much. Arthritis."

The interior was small but immaculate. Faded floral wallpaper, avocado green appliances, a sofa covered in plastic. Everything smelled like lemon Pledge and old coffee. A fan moved warm air around.

In a recliner by the window sat an elderly woman, easily in her eighties, thin as paper. Her hair was pure white, pulled back in a bun. She wore a housedress and slippers, a crocheted blanket across her lap despite the heat. Her eyes were sharp, though—dark and watchful.

"Mémère, these are my friends from the resort," Lisa said, using the Cajun term for grandmother. "Marcus, Jillian, Carter, Bobby. Everyone, this is my grandmother, Evangeline Thibodeaux."

"Doucet," the old woman said, looking at Bobby. "You're Marguerite's grandson. I see her in your face."

Bobby nodded, clearly uncomfortable. "Yes, ma'am. She passed in '75."

"I know. I was at her funeral." Evangeline's gaze swept the group. "Lisa says you want to know about Marie. About how she died."

"If you're willing to talk about it," Marcus said gently.

The old woman gestured to the sofa and kitchen chairs. "Sit. Lisa, make coffee for our guests."

They settled in while Lisa made coffee in the kitchenette. The percolator was from the fifties but still worked. Soon the smell of brewing chicory filled the space.

Evangeline was silent, staring out the window. When she spoke, her voice had a quality of recitation—like she'd told this story many times.

"Marie was my daughter. My only child. Born 1925, here in Emerald Bay. Beautiful. Smart. Could swim like a fish from the time she could walk. The gulf was her second home. She knew every current, every sandbar." The old woman's hands worked at the blanket. "She married young—seventeen. Had a baby the next year. Lisa's mother, Claudette."

Lisa brought coffee in mismatched mugs, distributed them, sat cross-legged on the floor near her grandmother's chair.

"Marie's husband worked on the shrimp boats," Evangeline continued. "Gone days at a time. Marie raised Claudette mostly alone, but she didn't mind. She loved that baby. Loved her life, despite the hardship. She was happy." The old woman's voice hardened. "Until June 12, 1959."

The room was silent except for the fan and the percolator's final pops.

"Marie went to town that afternoon. Thursday. Needed groceries, wanted to visit a friend. Claudette was with me—I was watching her. Marie said she'd be back by dinner. Six o'clock came. Seven. Eight. No Marie. Her husband was out on the boats, wouldn't be back until Friday. I waited. Worried. Around nine, I called the sheriff."

Evangeline sipped her coffee, hands shaking slightly.

"They found her body Friday morning. Washed up near the resort pier. Face down in the sand. The coroner said drowning. Said she must have gone swimming alone, got in trouble. But that made no sense. Marie wouldn't go swimming in her town clothes. Wouldn't go swimming alone at night. And she was too good a swimmer to drown in calm water."

"What did the sheriff say?" Jillian asked.

"Said accidents happen. Said maybe she'd been drinking, though Marie barely touched alcohol. Said maybe she slipped and hit her head, though there was no head injury. Said, said, said. Never said the truth." Evangeline's voice was bitter now. "Which was that they didn't want to investigate. Didn't want to look too hard. Because looking hard meant asking uncomfortable questions about who might want Marie dead and why."

"Did she have enemies?" Marcus asked.

"Marie? No. Everyone liked her. She was kind, generous. Helped her neighbors. Sang in the church choir." Evangeline paused. "Though... there was something. A few days before she died. She came home upset from the tavern. Said she'd had words with a man there. A local man."

Bobby leaned forward. "Who?"

"She wouldn't say. Just said he'd been talking strange. About the gulf, about respect, about tourists ruining the sacred waters. Marie had laughed—she thought he was joking, being dramatic. She said something flip back. Said the gulf water was too warm and murky compared to the Atlantic, or some such thing. Just casual conversation. But this man took offense. Got angry. Told her the gulf remembered disrespect. Told her to watch her tongue."

The group exchanged looks. The pattern was forming.

"Your grandmother," Evangeline said, looking at Bobby. "Marguerite. She came to see me after the funeral. Told me her own suspicions. Said drownings happened too often in Emerald Bay. Always tourists, she said, but sometimes locals too. The ones who spoke ill of the gulf. Who didn't show proper reverence." The old woman's eyes were wet. "She thought there was someone. Someone who appointed himself guardian. Who decided who deserved to drown."

"Did she know who?" Marcus asked.

"If she did, she didn't tell me. Probably afraid. This was a small town. Everyone knew everyone. Accusing someone of serial murder... you'd be driven out. Or worse." Evangeline wiped her eyes with a tissue from her housedr

ess pocket. "But she started keeping records. Writing down every drowning she heard about. Dates, names, circumstances. She showed me once—dozens of entries going back to 1958. All following the same pattern."

"Where's that notebook now?" Jillian asked.

Evangeline looked at Bobby. "Your grandmother's things. After she died. You said you found them in storage."

Bobby nodded slowly. "Boxes in my uncle's garage. I was a kid, didn't pay attention to most of it. But I remember a notebook. Spiral-bound, water-damaged. Full of handwriting."

"We need to find it," Marcus said. "That's documentation. Evidence of the pattern going back decades."

"I'll look," Bobby said. "I'll call my uncle tomorrow, go through the boxes."

Evangeline turned to Lisa. "Show them the photo."

Lisa stood, went to a shelf crowded with frames, and brought one back. She handed it to Marcus.

The photograph was black and white, edges worn. It showed a young woman on the beach—mid-thirties, smiling widely, dark hair whipping in the wind. She wore a one-piece swimsuit and held a little girl on her hip, maybe two years old. The child was laughing.

"That's Marie," Evangeline said. "And baby Claudette. Taken summer of 1958. Year before Marie died."

Marcus looked at the photo. Marie Thibodeaux looked so alive. Happy. Real. A person with a life and a daughter and plans. And someone had grabbed her ankles and held her underwater until she stopped fighting.

He felt rage building. Cold, focused rage.

"I believe you," Marcus said, looking at Evangeline. "I believe Marie was murdered. And I believe it's the same person—or the same type of person—who's killing now. We're going to find them. We're going to stop them. And we're going to make sure everyone knows what happened to Marie and all the others."

Evangeline studied him with those sharp dark eyes. "You're young to make such promises."

"Maybe. But I mean them anyway."

The old woman nodded slowly. "Then I'll help however I can. Marie deserves justice. Even if it comes sixty years too late."

They talked for another hour—Evangeline sharing what she remembered about the summer of 1959, the odd behaviors of certain locals, the way the sheriff had rushed to close the case. Lisa told them about growing up hearing stories about her grandmother she'd never met, the weight of grief that hung over her mother, the way Claudette never learned to swim because the water had taken her mother.

As they prepared to leave, Evangeline called Marcus back.

"The water," she said quietly. "The crying. I heard it that night. The night Marie died. I woke around three in the morning, heard a woman weeping. Came from the direction of the gulf. I thought I was dreaming. But it was real. I know it was real."

"You think it was a ghost?" Marcus asked carefully.

"I think it was something. Maybe grief given voice. Maybe something older. Or maybe just the wind." She gripped his hand with surprising strength. "But I also think there's a man. A flesh-and-blood man who kills people and hides behind folklore. Find him. Stop him. Before he takes any more daughters from their mothers."

Marcus promised he would.

Outside, the night had fully settled in. The group stood in Lisa's yard, processing what they'd learned.

"My uncle lives in Pensacola," Bobby said. "I can drive there tomorrow, go through my grandmother's stuff. Find that notebook."

"Do it," Marcus said. "That's our historical evidence. Establishes pattern, potentially identifies suspects."

Jillian was staring at the photograph Lisa had let them keep temporarily. "Marie was killed for insulting the gulf's water quality. That's the motive. Environmental zealotry taken to murderous extreme."

"It fits the recent victims too," Carter added. "The businessman who threw trash in the water. Bethany who was drunk and disrespectful. Potentially Mr. Hendricks—we should check if he did anything that could be perceived as disrespectful before he drowned."

Lisa was quiet, arms wrapped around herself. Marcus walked over to her.

"You okay?"

"I knew it wasn't an accident. My whole life, I knew. But hearing it confirmed... hearing that she died because of one careless comment..." Lisa's voice broke. "It's so stupid. So pointless."

"That's what makes killers like this so dangerous," Jillian said gently. "They have an internal logic that makes perfect sense to them but is completely insane to everyone else. To whoever's doing this, they're not a murderer. They're a protector. They're serving a higher purpose."

"We'll stop them," Marcus said. "We have momentum now. Evidence. Direction. We're close."

They made plans to reconvene the next morning—Bobby would hunt for his grandmother's notebook, Jillian would continue researching newspaper archives, Carter would keep working his social engineering at the tiki bar, and Marcus would maintain his watch of the beach while trying to identify victim-selection patterns.

Driving back to the resort in Carter's Trans Am, Marcus stared out at the dark landscape sliding past. Somewhere out there was the killer. Possibly someone he'd seen, maybe even spoken to. Someone who thought they were righteous.

And somewhere out there was the gulf, dark and patient and full of secrets it had kept for decades.

But secrets came out eventually. And when this one did, Marcus was going to make sure it burned bright enough to see from miles away.

Marie Thibodeaux deserved that much.

They all did.
