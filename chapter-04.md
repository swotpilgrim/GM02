# Chapter 4: Ghost Stories

The fire wasn't strictly allowed, but Bobby knew where to build it.

Two days after the second drowning, the group gathered on the beach after hours—far enough from the resort that Kowalski wouldn't notice, close enough for plausible deniability if questioned. The fire was small, just driftwood and some newspaper Bobby had scrounged, but it cast enough light to see each other's faces in the darkness.

Marcus sat on a piece of weathered timber, aviator sunglasses hung from his tank top collar. Jillian perched on a folded beach towel, knees drawn up, arms wrapped around them. Carter had brought a six-pack of Budweiser from the tiki bar, distributing cans to whoever wanted one. Lisa sat slightly apart, staring into the flames. Bobby tended the fire with a stick, poking at embers, not looking at anyone.

The beach felt different at night. During the day it was cheerful—families, sun, laughter. After dark, with just the fire and the endless black water, it felt ancient. Liminal. Like they were trespassing on something that belonged to the gulf.

Nobody had suggested this gathering explicitly. It had just happened. Two people dead in eight days, and nobody wanted to be alone with their thoughts.

"My grandmother used to bring me here," Lisa said suddenly, breaking the silence. Her voice was soft, almost swallowed by the sound of small waves lapping at the shore. "Not this exact spot, but close. She'd tell me stories while we watched the sunset."

"What kind of stories?" Jillian asked. She'd opened a beer but hadn't drunk much of it, just held the can like she needed something to do with her hands.

Lisa glanced at Bobby. Fellow locals, bearers of hometown secrets. "Ghost stories, mostly. Gulf Coast legends passed down through families."

"Folklore," Jillian said. "How communities process trauma, explain phenomena."

"Or just stories," Carter said, drinking. The past two days had shaken him.

"My grandmother believed them," Lisa said. "Said the gulf had memory. That it remembered things—people, events. Said if you listened, you could hear it speak."

"What would it say?" Marcus asked.

"Warnings, mostly. My grandmother said the gulf protected itself. Had ways of dealing with those who disrespected it."

"La Llorona," Bobby said abruptly. "Tell them about La Llorona."

"You tell it," Lisa said gently.

Bobby was quiet for a long moment. Then he took a drink of his beer—he'd been nursing the same can since they sat down—and began.

"La Llorona del Golfo. The Weeping Woman of the Gulf." He pronounced the Spanish carefully, the way someone who'd heard it repeated with reverence would. "Different versions exist up and down the coast. Mexican folklore, originally. But every culture that touches the Gulf has some variation. Our version..." He paused. "Our version is specific to Emerald Bay."

The fire crackled. Somewhere far down the beach, a night bird called out.

"1957," Bobby continued. "A woman named Caroline lived here. Married young, to a local man who'd gone off to war—Korea, I think. He came back in 1956, but he came back different. Shell-shocked, we'd call it now. PTSD. Back then, people just said the war had changed him. Made him mean."

Jillian shifted on her towel, pulled her knees tighter. The scientific part of her brain recognized this as a campfire ghost story, but the primitive part—the part that feared darkness and unknown depths—was listening raptly.

"Caroline tried to make it work," Bobby said. "My grandmother knew her, said she was kind. Patient. But her husband got worse. Drank. Got violent. Caroline was isolated—back then, you didn't talk about those things. You certainly didn't leave."

"Jesus," Carter muttered.

"One night in summer 1957, Caroline walked into the gulf and didn't come back out." Bobby's voice was flat, reciting facts. "They found her body three days later, washed up near the pier. Drowning, they said. Ruled it an accident, but everyone knew. She'd chosen the water over whatever her life had become."

Lisa was staring at the gulf now, the black water barely visible beyond the fire's light. "That's not where the story ends."

"No." Bobby threw more driftwood on. "After she died, people started hearing crying from the water at night. A woman's voice, weeping. Some claimed to see her—a figure in white, standing in the shallows."

"Mass hysteria," Jillian said, unconvinced. "Communal trauma."

"Maybe. But then the drownings started."

Marcus felt a chill. "What drownings?"

"Tourists. Starting about a year after Caroline died. One or two every summer. Always people from out of town. Always in calm water. Always unexplained. My grandmother kept track. Wrote down every drowning she heard about. Dozens of names. Dates. From 1958 up to when she died in '75."

"How many?" Marcus asked.

"Forty? Fifty? Some might've been accidents, but the pattern was there."

"What pattern?" Jillian asked.

"Behavior," Lisa said. "The victims' behavior before they died. According to the legend, Caroline took the ones who disrespected the gulf. Litterers. People who peed in the water. Drunk idiots who threw bottles. Tourists who treated the beach like their playground."

"Environmental vigilante ghost," Carter said with a laugh that sounded forced. "That's a new one."

"Laugh if you want." Bobby's voice had an edge. "But I've lived here my whole life. I've seen what I've seen. Heard what I've heard."

"What have you seen?" Marcus asked.

Bobby was quiet. The fire popped.

"I was eleven. Couldn't sleep one night—hot, no AC. Walked to the beach around midnight. Saw someone at the waterline, talking to the waves."

"Who?" Jillian asked.

"A local man. Someone everyone knew. He was on his knees in the sand, having a conversation with the gulf. Asking questions. Pausing like he was listening. I heard him say Caroline's name."

The group was silent.

"He saw me watching. Smiled. Said: 'She speaks to those who listen, boy. The gulf remembers.' Then went back to his conversation. I ran home."

"Who was it?" Marcus asked.

Bobby stared into the fire. "Doesn't matter. Point is, locals know. Something's in the water. Something that judges."

Lisa hugged her knees tighter. "My great-grandmother heard the crying. The night my grandmother died. She swore to it until the day she died herself. Said she woke up around three a.m. to the sound of a woman weeping. Looked out the window toward the gulf and heard it clear as day. By morning, they'd found my grandmother's body."

"1959," Jillian said. "Your grandmother drowned in 1959. You said that before."

"Yes."

"Two years after Caroline. Right in the middle of Bobby's grandmother's drowning timeline."

Lisa nodded. The two locals looked at each other, something heavy and unspoken passing between them. The weight of being from a place that held dark secrets in its collective memory.

"Let's think logically," Carter said. "Ghost stories emerge from real events. Caroline probably existed—that's historical fact. Beaches have drownings—statistical fact. Pattern-seeking brains see connections in coincidence. Add folklore and communal grief, you get a legend. Doesn't mean there's an actual ghost."

"No," Marcus said. "But it might mean something else."

Everyone looked at him.

"What if the legend is covering something real? Not supernatural, but human. What if someone has been drowning tourists for decades, and the La Llorona legend provides perfect cover?"

Jillian's eyes widened. "If the locals believe in the legend, they'd attribute the drownings to the ghost rather than looking for a human culprit."

"Exactly. Self-reinforcing. Every drowning strengthens the legend. Makes people less likely to ask questions."

"But who?" Carter asked.

Marcus pulled out the Polaroid. Tom Harris's ankles, bruising stark. "Someone who knows these waters. Someone local. Someone who believes they're serving some higher purpose."

"Serving Caroline," Lisa whispered.

"Or serving an idea of Caroline. Environmental purity. Punishing disrespect." Marcus looked around the fire. "Those marks are real. Both victims had them. That's not a ghost. That's a person. Someone operating for years, maybe since the late fifties, protected by a legend that makes investigation ridiculous."

Bobby threw his beer can into the fire with sudden violence. "You're saying someone in Emerald Bay has been murdering tourists for twenty years. Someone we know."

"It's a possibility."

"That's insane."

"Is it?" Jillian challenged. "A serial killer protected by folklore. Who would investigate a ghost?"

Lisa was crying silently. "My grandmother. Someone murdered her and everyone just... accepted it. Because of a story."

Marcus sat next to her. "We don't know that for certain. But if there's even a chance, we have to find out. For her. For Bethany. For Tom. For all of them."

The fire was dying now, embers glowing red against black sand. Out on the water, something made a sound—a bird, probably, or wind through the pier pilings. But in the dark, with everything they'd just discussed, it sounded like crying. A woman's voice, distant and mournful.

Lisa's head snapped toward the water. "Do you hear it?"

They listened. Marcus heard waves, wind, fire crackling. And underneath, barely audible, something that might be crying. Or might be nothing.

"I hear it," Lisa said, shaking. "She's there."

Bobby stared at the gulf. Jillian looked skeptical but uneasy. Carter was silent.

"It could be wind. Birds. The mind finding patterns," Marcus said.

"Or it's her," Lisa insisted.

"There's no one there," Jillian said, uncertain. "It's acoustics. Sound waves creating auditory pareidolia."

"Use smaller words," Carter muttered.

Lisa was standing now, walking toward the waterline. Marcus followed. The water lapped at her feet.

"If you're there," Lisa said to the darkness, "help us. Help us find who's doing this."

Only the waves answered.

Lisa turned back, face wet with tears but expression determined. "Real or not, ghost or killer or both—we have to stop this. We have to end it."

"Agreed," Marcus said. The others nodded.

Five young people who should have been enjoying summer, now committed to hunting whatever was in the water.

"Tomorrow," Marcus said, "we start investigating properly. Jillian—research drownings. Death certificates, newspaper articles, microfiche."

"I can do that," Jillian said.

"Carter—use your charm and money. Talk to locals, buy drinks, see what people remember."

Carter nodded.

"Bobby, Lisa—you know this place. Think about who's been here the whole time. Who has the knowledge, access, capability."

They nodded, Bobby pale.

"And I'll watch the water. If this is a human killer, they're using the gulf to hunt. They have patterns. I'll find them."

They kicked sand over the fire, scattering embers. The walk back was quiet, each person lost in thought.

Marcus paused before his room, looking back at the gulf. Moonlight painted the water silver. Beautiful. Peaceful. Deadly.

Somewhere out there, something was waiting. Real or imagined, ghost or killer or both.

And Marcus was going to find it.
