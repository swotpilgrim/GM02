# Chapter 13: The Interview

Marcus returned to Wade's Gulf Diving at four p.m., Carter beside him.

"You're sure about this?" Carter asked as they parked.

"We need to understand him. Not just what he does, but why. And the best way to understand someone is to let them talk."

"What if he realizes we're investigating?"

"Then we play dumb. You're good at that."

"Hey—"

"I mean that as a compliment. You're charming, disarming. Use it." Marcus grabbed a notebook. "I'm a newcomer to the area, interested in local diving culture. You're my rich friend who's curious about everything. We want Cyrus's expertise. People love sharing expertise."

They entered the shop. The bell chimed. Cyrus looked up from behind the counter where he was organizing dive weights by size and weight, each one precisely placed.

"Marcus! Back already? Everything go alright with the rental?"

"Perfect, thanks. The gulf was beautiful." Marcus gestured to Carter. "This is my friend Carter. He's thinking about getting certified, wanted to talk to someone who knows the local diving scene."

Cyrus's face lit up. "Always happy to talk diving. You boys want coffee? I've got a pot brewing in back."

They followed him through a door marked "Employees Only" into a small office-slash-storage room. Shelves lined with equipment, a desk buried under dive logs and repair manuals, and a Mr. Coffee percolating on a filing cabinet. Photos covered the walls—underwater scenes, boats, divers, reef formations.

Cyrus poured three cups, handed them over. The coffee was strong enough to strip paint.

"So, certification," Cyrus said, settling into his desk chair. "Best decision you'll ever make. Opens up a whole new world. The surface is where humans live, but the depths—that's where the truth is."

Carter sipped coffee, played his role. "I've heard the Gulf of Mexico is different from ocean diving. Warmer, right?"

"Warmer, yes. But more than that—she's gentler. If you respect her." Cyrus's eyes took on that distant quality Marcus had noticed before. "The gulf is alive. I don't mean metaphorically. I mean she has a spirit. A consciousness. You dive her waters long enough, you feel it."

"Consciousness?" Marcus prompted, writing in his notebook like a diligent student.

"People think water is just hydrogen and oxygen. Chemistry. But the gulf is ancient. Millions of years old. Millions of lives lived and died in her embrace. That leaves a mark. A memory." Cyrus stood, walked to a photo on the wall—a black and white image of a young woman on a beach, 1950s bathing suit, beautiful smile. "My wife Caroline understood that. She was born here, raised on these waters. She knew how to listen."

"Your wife dove?" Carter asked.

"Swam mostly. Like a fish. More graceful than any diver I've seen." Cyrus's voice softened. "She passed in 1957. The gulf took her home. She's part of it now."

Marcus felt a chill. "I'm sorry. That must have been difficult."

"It was her place. Where she belonged. I hear her sometimes, in the waves. When I dive at dawn, I feel her presence. She speaks to those who listen." Cyrus turned back to them, pale blue eyes intense. "That's what tourists don't understand. They come here thinking the gulf is theirs to use. To pollute. To disrespect. They throw trash, urinate in the shallows, tear up the seagrass with their boats. They don't understand they're desecrating something sacred."

"Must be frustrating," Marcus said carefully, "seeing people treat the water carelessly."

"Frustrating. Yes. That's one word for it." Cyrus began humming—low, melodic, hymn-like. He cleaned an already-clean dive mask while he hummed, movements precise and ritualistic. "But the gulf has her ways. She cleanses herself. She knows who respects her and who doesn't. And she acts accordingly."

Carter shifted in his seat. "Acts accordingly how?"

Cyrus smiled. It didn't reach his eyes. "The disrespectful don't last long. Never have. There's a local legend—La Llorona del Golfo. The Weeping Woman. Supposedly she drowns sinners who pollute the waters. Local folklore, you understand. But folklore often holds truth."

"I heard about the recent drownings," Marcus said, watching Cyrus's face. "Three people in the past two weeks. Terrible tragedy."

Cyrus's expression didn't change. No surprise. No concern. No grief. Just calm acceptance.

"Terrible," he agreed. "But not unexpected. The gulf claims the disrespectful. Always has. Those three—I knew them, actually. Rented equipment from me. Nice enough people on the surface, but..." He trailed off, shook his head. "The gulf sees deeper than surface. She knows intentions. Knows hearts."

"You think they were disrespectful?" Marcus kept his voice neutral, journalistic.

"I know they were. The businessman threw beer cans in the water while I watched from my boat. Laughed about it. The college girl and her friends treated the beach like a toilet. The Ohio man argued with me directly when I asked him to pick up his trash. Called me an old fool." Cyrus's smile widened slightly. "The gulf doesn't forget. She remembers every slight. Every piece of trash. Every drop of contamination. And she balances the scales."

The way he said it—matter-of-fact, like describing weather patterns—made Marcus's skin crawl.

"Do you think the drownings were connected?" Carter asked. "I mean, three in two weeks is unusual, right?"

Cyrus returned to his desk, sat back down, steepled his fingers. "Connected to what? To each other? To some human cause?" He shook his head. "The gulf works in her own time, by her own rules. Sometimes she's patient. Sometimes she acts swiftly. But she always acts justly."

"You sound like you approve," Marcus said quietly.

"Approve? No. Understand? Yes." Cyrus leaned forward. "I spent three years in the Navy diving in the Pacific. Saw men die underwater—equipment failures, nitrogen narcosis, shark attacks. Saw the ocean take and take and take. Came home believing water was the enemy. But Caroline taught me differently. Taught me the gulf wasn't cruel—she was discerning. She protected herself. Protected those who respected her. And punished those who didn't."

"After Caroline died," Carter said, "did you ever think about leaving? Starting fresh somewhere else?"

"Leave?" Cyrus looked genuinely puzzled. "Why would I leave? Caroline is here. Part of the water, part of the currents. I dive these waters every day. Talk to her. She tells me things. About the tourists. About who deserves the gulf's mercy and who deserves her judgment." He said it like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Marcus wrote in his notebook to avoid showing reaction. This man was either deeply delusional or a serial killer masking confession as philosophy. Possibly both.

"You dive every day?" Marcus asked.

"Morning or evening, depending on business. The reef shelf sixty yards offshore—that's my church. That's where I commune with Caroline, with the gulf, with the truth beneath the surface." He stood, walked to another photo—an underwater shot of a reef, colorful fish, crystal water. "You should dive it. Experience the sacred firsthand."

"Maybe we will," Carter said.

Cyrus turned to them, those pale eyes unsettling in their intensity. "If you do, remember: the gulf rewards respect. You treat her right, speak to her with reverence, acknowledge her power—she'll show you wonders. But disrespect her..." He smiled. "Well. You've seen what happens to the disrespectful."

Marcus closed his notebook. "We should get going. Thanks for the coffee and the conversation."

"Anytime. That's what I'm here for—helping people understand the gulf. Respect the gulf." Cyrus walked them to the door. "Be safe out there. Stay within your limits. And listen. The water speaks to those who have ears to hear."

They left. The bell chimed behind them. Marcus waited until they were in Carter's Trans Am, doors closed, before speaking.

"He's the killer."

Carter started the engine. "He's either the killer or the weirdest old man I've ever met."

"Did you hear him? The way he talked about the drownings? No surprise. No concern. Just satisfaction. Like he was describing natural selection."

"He could just be a strange guy with strong environmental opinions."

"He said Caroline speaks to him underwater. Said the gulf 'acts justly' when it kills disrespectful tourists. Said he knew all three victims rented from him and were disrespectful." Marcus replayed the conversation in his mind. "That wasn't philosophy. That was confession wrapped in mysticism."

Carter drove toward the resort, quiet. Finally: "The photo. The one of Caroline on the beach. Did you see the date written on the back?"

"No. What did it say?"

"1957. Same year she drowned. He keeps her photo prominently displayed, talks about her in present tense, believes she communicates with him from beyond the grave." Carter tapped the steering wheel. "That's not healthy grief. That's delusion. And delusion like that can justify anything."

Marcus stared out at the gulf, visible between buildings as they drove. "He thinks he's doing her work. Purifying the waters in her name. The legend of La Llorona—he believes it. Maybe even believes he's fulfilling it."

"A righteous killer is the most dangerous kind."

"Yes. Because he won't stop. Can't stop. In his mind, he's protecting something sacred. Every victim is a cleansing. Every drowning is justified."

They pulled into the resort parking lot. The sun was setting, tourists were gathering for dinner, children were playing in the pool. Normal vacation sounds. Safe sounds.

And five miles away, Cyrus Wade was probably closing his shop, organizing his equipment with ritualistic precision, humming hymns, preparing for another dive.

Another communion with his dead wife.

Another search for sinners who needed drowning.

"We go to the police tomorrow," Marcus said. "First thing. We have physical evidence, victim patterns, psychological profile, and now we have his own words. It's enough."

"Is it? Because all we really have is one weird conversation and some ropes that could have a dozen innocent explanations."

"Combined with everything else—"

"Combined with everything else, we have circumstantial evidence and suspicion. That's not enough for an arrest. Maybe not enough for an investigation."

Marcus knew Carter was right. But they had to try.

"Tomorrow," he repeated. "We take everything to state police. Make them listen."

"And if they don't?"

Marcus looked at the gulf, darkening as night fell. "Then we stop him ourselves."

Carter didn't ask how. He probably didn't want to know.

They sat in the car, watching tourists laugh and splash and enjoy their vacations, ignorant of the man who watched them from his dive shop, making calculations, passing judgments, preparing to cleanse.

The hunt was nearly over.

One way or another, Cyrus Wade's reign would end.

The gulf would stop weeping.

And the dead would be avenged.

Tomorrow.
