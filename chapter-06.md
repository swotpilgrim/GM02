# Chapter 6: Taking It Seriously

Mr. Kowalski called the emergency staff meeting for noon the day after the third drowning.

The resort office smelled like stale coffee and desperation. Kowalski sat behind his desk—fake wood veneer from the sixties—looking ten years older than two weeks ago. Mid-sixties, Polish immigrant who'd bought the Sandpiper in 1970. Now his American dream was drowning.

The group crowded into the small room. A window AC unit rattled against the heat.

"Three drownings in eleven days," Kowalski said without preamble. His accent was thicker when stressed. "Yesterday, the Hendricks family—father dead, wife and son traumatized. This morning, eight families checked out. Eight. The resort is at fifteen percent capacity. By next week, we'll have nobody."

"Maybe that's for the best," Marcus said. "Until we figure out what's happening—"

"What's happening?" Kowalski's voice rose. "I tell you what's happening. Bad luck. Coincidence. People who don't know how to swim thinking the gulf is a bathtub."

"All three victims were experienced swimmers," Jillian interjected. "The first man swam in college. Bethany Cross was on her high school swim team. Mr. Hendricks was a lifeguard in his youth."

"Then they had medical emergencies. Heart attacks, strokes. These things happen."

"Not three times in eleven days," Marcus said. "Not in calm water. Not in identical circumstances."

Kowalski slammed his hand on the desk. "Do not spread panic! The authorities have investigated. Deputy Collins ruled all three accidental. Case closed."

"Collins is wrong," Marcus said flatly.

"Collins is law enforcement. You are college student playing lifeguard for summer job." Kowalski pointed at the door. "Your job is watch beach, save swimmers, reassure guests. Not play detective. Not invent conspiracy theories."

"Sir, with respect—"

"No respect. You want respect, you do your job. Starting now, new rules." Kowalski pulled out a typed memo. "Rule one: No staff discusses drownings with guests. Questions about safety, you refer to me. Rule two: No speculation about causes. We say accidents, tragic but rare. Rule three: No talking to media. Reporter shows up, you say nothing, you find me."

Lisa spoke up quietly. "Mr. Kowalski, people died. Don't we have a responsibility—"

"Responsibility is keeping business alive. Fifty people work here. Cooks, maids, maintenance, you. Resort closes, everyone loses jobs. You want that?"

Nobody answered.

"I thought not." Kowalski's voice softened slightly. "Look, I understand. You're young, you're scared. But the best thing we can do is return to normal. Show guests the beach is safe. The drownings were terrible accidents. But they're over now. Lightning doesn't strike four times."

Marcus thought about the bruises on three sets of ankles. "And if it does?"

"Then we deal with it. But until then, we reassure. We smile. We make tourists feel safe. Understood?"

Murmurs of reluctant agreement. Kowalski dismissed them.

In the hallway outside, Carter let out a long breath. "Well, that was..."

"Bullshit," Bobby finished. He was leaning against the wall, arms crossed. "He doesn't care if people die. Just cares about his bottom line."

"That's not fair," Lisa said. "He's scared. The resort is his life."

"And those three people? That was their lives too. Actual lives, not business investments."

Marcus watched them argue, his mind elsewhere. Kowalski's directive was clear: shut up, smile, pretend nothing was wrong. And if another tourist drowned? Smile wider, I guess.

"We need to talk," Marcus said. "Somewhere private."

They convened in Bobby's maintenance shed, a cinder block building that smelled like motor oil and cut grass. Bobby locked the door. Jillian sat on an overturned bucket. Carter leaned against a workbench covered in tools. Lisa perched on a step ladder. Marcus remained standing.

"Kowalski just told us to ignore a serial killer," Marcus said.

"We don't know it's a serial killer," Carter countered. "We have suspicions, circumstantial evidence—"

"I saw the third victim's ankles. Same bruising. Same pattern." Marcus pulled out his Polaroid collection—three photos now, taken quickly when no one was looking. Tom Harris, Bethany Cross, James Hendricks. All showed oval bruising on both ankles. "Someone is grabbing victims and drowning them."

Jillian took the photos, studied them with a scientist's focus. "The consistency is damning. Same location, same pattern, same pressure indicators. This isn't coincidental trauma. This is signature behavior."

"Okay, so someone's drowning people," Carter said. "What do we do? We're not cops. We have no authority, no resources, no legal standing to investigate."

"We have eyes," Marcus said. "We have access. We know this place."

"And the deputy thinks we're hysterical kids."

"Then we bypass the deputy. We gather evidence so overwhelming that even Collins can't dismiss it. We document everything, build a case, force them to take us seriously."

Lisa had been quiet, but now she spoke. "My grandmother. 1959. Twenty years ago. If this has been happening that long..." Her voice cracked. "How many people? How many families got told it was an accident when it was murder?"

The weight of that settled over the group. Not three victims. Potentially dozens. Spanning decades. A serial killer operating in plain sight, protected by dismissive authorities and a ghost story that explained away the impossible.

"We investigate," Bobby said. Everyone turned to look at him. He rarely contributed, usually just made sarcastic comments and drank in corners. But now his expression was grim determination. "Lisa's right. My grandmother kept lists—drownings going back to the fifties. If this bastard has been killing twenty years, there's a pattern. We find it."

"How?" Carter asked.

Marcus had been thinking about this since the campfire. "We divide tasks. Jillian—you're the scientist. Research the drownings. Newspaper archives, death records, anything public. Look for patterns in timing, victim selection, methodology."

Jillian nodded. "The library has newspaper microfiche going back to the forties. I can pull drowning reports, compare circumstances."

"Carter—you're charming and rich. Use both. Talk to locals, especially long-timers who'd remember twenty years back. Buy drinks at the bar, be friendly, ask casual questions about the old days. See what stories people tell when their guard is down."

"Social engineering," Carter said. "I can do that."

"Bobby, Lisa—you're from here. Think about who's been around the whole time. Who has the local knowledge, the diving skills, the opportunity. Who fits the profile."

Bobby's jaw was tight. "You're asking us to suspect our neighbors."

"I'm asking you to save lives."

Lisa put her hand on Bobby's arm. "He's right. If someone we know is doing this, we have to find out. Before someone else dies."

Bobby nodded slowly. "Okay. We'll make a list. People who've been in Emerald Bay since the fifties. People connected to the water."

"What about you?" Jillian asked Marcus. "What's your task?"

"I'm watching the gulf. If this is a human killer using underwater approach, they have patterns. Times of day, victim selection, hunting grounds. I'm going to watch every swimmer, document every detail, until I see something that doesn't fit." He paused. "And I'm going to examine every drowning victim from here on. No matter what Kowalski says. Those bruises are evidence, and I'm collecting it."

"From here on?" Carter's eyes widened. "You think there'll be more?"

"I know there will. Three deaths in eleven days isn't an ending. It's an escalation. Something triggered this. Something changed. The killer is active, hunting aggressively. We need to figure out why before the fourth victim shows up."

The shed was silent except for the hum of fluorescent lights. Outside, a lawn mower started up—probably resort maintenance, keeping up appearances while the bodies piled up.

"So we're doing this," Carter said. "Actually investigating murders."

"Yes."

"Could get us fired. Probably will."

"Yes."

"Could be dangerous. If the killer finds out we're looking for them—"

"Then we're careful," Marcus said. "We share information only with each other. We don't advertise what we're doing. And we watch each other's backs."

Jillian stood up from her bucket. "When do we start?"

"Now. Jillian, library's open until five. Carter, happy hour at the tiki bar starts at four—perfect time to chat up the regulars. Bobby, Lisa—make that list tonight. We reconvene tomorrow morning, compare notes."

They stood in a loose circle, five young people who'd come to the Gulf Coast for summer work and were now hunting a serial killer. It should have felt absurd. Instead it felt necessary. Inevitable.

"One more thing," Marcus said. "The ghost story. La Llorona del Golfo. The weeping woman who drowns sinners. Someone started that legend. Someone benefits from it. Maybe decades ago, maybe recently. But that story is cover. Protection. We figure out who needs that protection, we find our killer."

"Could be anyone," Bobby said. "The legend's been around since the fifties. Half the town believes in it."

"Then we narrow it down. Age, capability, motive, opportunity. Same as any investigation."

Lisa was staring at the photos of the bruised ankles. "Whoever's doing this... they're strong. They can overpower adult swimmers underwater. They're not afraid of being seen. They're... confident."

"Or desperate," Jillian added. "The escalation suggests loss of control. Three killings in under two weeks after potentially years of slower pacing. Something changed. Something triggered this."

"Environmental," Bobby said suddenly. "The victims. What if they really were chosen for being disrespectful? What if the killer believes they're serving the ghost? Doing Caroline's work?"

Marcus considered it. "True believer. Someone who thinks they're purifying the gulf. That would explain the pattern—victim selection based on behavior, not random targeting."

"It would also mean they won't stop," Jillian said quietly. "True believers don't quit. They double down."

The implication hung heavy. They were dealing with someone who thought they were righteous. Someone who wouldn't surrender, wouldn't feel guilty, wouldn't stop until they were stopped.

"Then we stop them," Marcus said. "Fast. Before the body count gets higher."

They dispersed to their tasks. Marcus watched them go—Jillian heading toward her car for the drive to the library, Carter toward the resort to prep for his social engineering, Bobby and Lisa walking together toward town, heads close in conversation.

Marcus stood alone in the shed, looking at the three Polaroids. Three lives ended. Three families destroyed. Twenty years of potential victims before them.

Kowalski's directive: pretend everything is fine.

Kowalski could go to hell.

Marcus was going to find the truth. And he was going to make sure everyone knew it.

The gulf had a secret. And secrets, once exposed to sunlight, died screaming.

He put the photos in his pocket, locked the shed behind him, and headed for the beach. The afternoon sun was brutal, the sand almost too hot to walk on. Tourists scattered across the beach looked happy. Ignorant. Safe.

Marcus climbed into his tower and picked up his binoculars.

Time to watch.

Time to wait.

And when the killer made their move—because they would, he was certain—Marcus would be ready.
