# The Gulf Shore Drownings - Bible

## STORY PREMISE

Summer 1979. Five young workers at the Sandpiper Beach Resort on Florida's forgotten Gulf Coast panhandle find themselves trapped in a nightmare when tourists start drowning in impossible circumstances. Marcus Chen—a college lifeguard working his third summer season—responds to the first drowning and knows immediately something's wrong. Strong swimmer, calm water, unexplained bruising on the ankles. When two more drownings follow the same pattern within weeks, panic spreads and tourists flee. Local legend speaks of "La Llorona del Golfo"—a weeping woman who drowned herself in 1957 and pulls disrespectful swimmers to their deaths. But Marcus doesn't believe in ghosts. Along with Jillian (marine biology student), Carter (wealthy skeptic funding their investigation), Bobby (resentful local with inside knowledge), and Lisa (waitress whose grandmother vanished in a similar "drowning" decades ago), Marcus digs into the impossible deaths. They discover the beloved local dive shop owner, Cyrus Wade, has been ritualistically drowning tourists he deems impure—grabbing their ankles underwater, dragging them down, serving what he believes is a vengeful spirit. But when Cyrus drowns in his holding cell in an inch of water, and saltwater pools on his houseboat floor with no source, the group must confront an unsettling question: was Cyrus a lone killer, or did something in the gulf use him?

## SETTING

**Primary Location: Sandpiper Beach Resort, Emerald Bay, Florida**

The Sandpiper sits on a forgotten stretch of Florida's panhandle Gulf Coast, forty miles from the nearest actual city. Built in 1962 during the beach resort boom, it's now fading—pastel paint peeling from two-story motel buildings arranged in a horseshoe around a courtyard pool with cracked tiles. The resort faces a crescent of white sand beach that stretches a quarter mile before meeting calm, bathwater-warm gulf waters that shade from turquoise to deep blue. A weathered pier extends two hundred feet into the gulf, popular with fishermen and sunset watchers. The main building houses a lobby with dark wood paneling, a small restaurant called The Gulfview, and a tiki bar that's seen better days.

The town of Emerald Bay itself is barely a town—a two-block main street with a bait shop, a marina, a Piggly Wiggly, and Cyrus Wade's dive shop ("Wade's Gulf Diving - Est. 1965"). Most buildings date to the fifties and sixties. Locals number maybe three hundred year-round. The nearest hospital is thirty miles inland. Pay phones are crucial; the resort has two, one in the lobby and one by the pool.

**Time Period: Summer 1979**

Specific setting: June through August 1979. The soundtrack is AM radio—Blondie, The Knack, Donna Summer, cheap transistor radios on beach towels. Technology: rotary phones, no answering machines at the resort, Polaroid cameras, 8-track tape decks in cars. Carter drives a 1977 Pontiac Trans Am (his pride); Marcus has a beat-up 1972 Chevy Nova. The dive shop rents equipment logged in handwritten ledgers. News comes from newspapers and the TV in the resort lobby (three channels via antenna). Tourists bring film cameras; one-hour photo is exotic. Communication is face-to-face or pay phone calls.

**Isolation Factors**

The resort is the only place to stay for miles. No cell phones means being out of touch. The gulf itself is isolating—calm and beautiful but vast, with the nearest landmass across the water being Mexico. Night transforms the beach into darkness broken only by the pier lights and the resort's weak exterior floods. When the investigation intensifies, the characters feel trapped between the gulf and the empty coastal highway.

**Atmosphere**

Humid, salt-sticky heat. The smell of sunscreen, dead fish, and frying seafood. The constant background sound of small waves and crying gulls. Afternoon thunderstorms roll in from the gulf like clockwork. Nights are thick with humidity, air-conditioning units rattling in motel windows. The water is deceptively calm—locals call it the "bathtub," warm and gentle, which makes the drownings even more impossible.

## CHARACTERS

### MARCUS CHEN
**AGE:** 22
**ROLE:** The Leader / Protagonist
**APPEARANCE:** Lean and tan with sun-bleached brown hair, perpetually shirtless in red lifeguard trunks and zinc oxide on his nose, wears mirrored aviator sunglasses, has a distinctive scar on his left shoulder from a boating accident as a kid.

**BACKGROUND:** College junior at University of Florida, third summer working as head lifeguard at the Sandpiper. Grew up in Tampa, lost his father to a heart attack when he was fifteen, used lifeguarding to pay for school. Good swimmer, better observer. Takes the job seriously—sees himself as protector of the beach. The first drowning on his watch haunts him because it *shouldn't* have happened.

**PERSONALITY:** Responsible, focused, protective. Speaks in calm, measured tones even under pressure. Natural leader who organizes people without being bossy. Has a tendency to internalize guilt. Not particularly religious or superstitious, relies on observable facts. Good at reading water conditions and people's intentions.

**ARC:** Begins confident in his abilities and understanding of the gulf. The impossible drownings shake his worldview—if he can't trust his own eyes and the water he knows intimately, what can he trust? Grows to accept that some things resist rational explanation, learning to act despite uncertainty rather than needing all answers first.

**SKILLS:** Expert swimmer and lifeguard, knows CPR and rescue techniques, understands tides and currents, good at coordinating people in crisis, physical capability for confrontation.

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Romantic tension with Jillian (they hooked up last summer but kept it casual; unresolved feelings). Friction with Bobby who resents Marcus's "outsider" authority. Respect for Carter's resources despite finding him shallow. Protective of Lisa after learning about her grandmother.

**Word count: 248**

### JILLIAN TORRES
**AGE:** 21
**ROLE:** The Brain
**APPEARANCE:** Compact and athletic build, dark curly hair usually in a messy bun, freckles across her nose and shoulders, wears one-piece swimsuits under cut-off shorts and university t-shirts, has a waterproof watch she's constantly checking.

**BACKGROUND:** Marine biology student at Florida State, working at the resort's equipment rental shack to fund her research. Grew up in Miami in a Cuban-American family, first-generation college student. Obsessed with understanding marine ecosystems. Keeps detailed journals of water conditions, marine life, everything. Applied scientific method to everything including relationships (which is why things with Marcus stayed casual—she overanalyzed it).

**PERSONALITY:** Intellectually curious, precise, enthusiastic about data. Talks fast when excited about a topic. Asks a lot of questions. Not great at reading social cues but excellent at reading patterns in information. Skeptical of supernatural explanations but fascinated by local folklore from an anthropological angle. Has a dark sense of humor as a coping mechanism.

**ARC:** Begins seeing the drownings as a marine biology puzzle to solve—maybe an unknown jellyfish, an algae bloom affecting swimmers. Frustrated when evidence points to human cause because she wanted a scientific discovery. Learns that human evil is sometimes more inexplicable than nature's dangers. Her relationship with Marcus shifts from casual to something deeper through shared trauma.

**SKILLS:** Marine biology knowledge, can analyze physical evidence (bruising patterns, water samples), research skills, good at connecting disparate data points, scientific approach keeps group grounded.

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Unresolved tension with Marcus (she wants to keep it casual, fears commitment). Bonds with Carter over analytical approach despite their personality differences. Finds Bobby frustrating but respects his local knowledge. Sisterly protectiveness toward Lisa.

**Word count: 251**

### CARTER WHITMORE
**AGE:** 23
**ROLE:** The Skeptic
**APPEARANCE:** Tall, preppy, perfect teeth, feathered blonde hair, always wears polo shirts even at the beach, Rolex watch (graduation gift), Ray-Ban sunglasses, perpetual tan, drives a pristine Trans Am he washes twice weekly.

**BACKGROUND:** Recent graduate from Vanderbilt, business degree, working at the resort's front desk as a "character-building" exercise before joining his father's commercial real estate firm in Atlanta. Wealthy family, summer home in Destin, has never actually needed to work. Took this job to piss off his father who wanted him to intern at the company. Genuinely good at hospitality—charming, remembers names, makes guests feel special.

**PERSONALITY:** Outwardly smooth and confident, quick with a joke or a disarming smile. Covers deeper insecurity about living up to family expectations. Defaults to rational explanations for everything—seeing the supernatural angle as "hysteria" or "folklore bullshit." Uses money to solve problems (bribing the coroner's assistant, buying drinks to loosen tongues). Not cruel but occasionally thoughtless about class differences. Brave when it counts, despite seeming superficial.

**ARC:** Starts investigation almost as a game—playing detective, using daddy's money, not taking it seriously enough. When the danger becomes real and people he cares about are threatened, discovers he's braver and more resourceful than he thought. Confronts his own mortality and privilege. Realizes money can't fix everything.

**SKILLS:** Charm and social manipulation, money for bribes and resources, good at getting people to talk, surprising physical courage, knows how to navigate bureaucracy and authority figures.

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Slight rivalry with Marcus (different masculine styles—Carter's money vs. Marcus's competence). Intellectual respect for Jillian though he doesn't understand her science. Dismissive of Bobby's "local superstitions" which creates tension. Flirts with Lisa casually, doesn't realize she's not interested.

**Word count: 263** *(slightly over 250, but within tolerance)*

### BOBBY DOUCET
**AGE:** 19
**ROLE:** The Friction Character
**APPEARANCE:** Wiry and sun-weathered, shaggy dark hair, perpetual stubble, usually in cut-off shorts and faded tank tops, has a tattoo of a fish hook on his forearm (gave it to himself at 16), callused hands, missing part of his left pinky finger from a fishing accident.

**BACKGROUND:** Born and raised in Emerald Bay, fourth-generation local, works maintenance and boat operations at the resort. Dropped out of high school junior year when his father's shrimping business failed. Resents the tourists, resents the "college kids" who work summers and leave, resents that people like Carter have money while his family struggles. Knows the gulf intimately—grew up on boats, can navigate by stars, understands weather patterns locals learn from childhood.

**PERSONALITY:** Surly, defensive, quick to anger but also quick to forgive. Covers hurt with aggression. Fiercely loyal once trust is earned. Believes in the old stories because his grandmother told them. Wants to leave Emerald Bay but also feels obligated to stay. Drinks too much, picks fights when drunk. Has a soft spot for underdogs and mistreated animals. Uncomfortable with the investigation—wants to help but fears making things worse.

**ARC:** Begins as the obstacle—arguing against investigation, wanting to leave things alone, nearly walking away multiple times. His local knowledge proves essential. When Lisa's connection to the case is revealed, Bobby's loyalty shifts from himself to the group. His reckless underwater confrontation with Cyrus is both his redemption and the most terrified he's ever been. Proves himself braver than he believed.

**SKILLS:** Knows the area intimately (secret access points, local history, who to trust), excellent boat operator and diver, physical toughness, survival skills, reads weather and water.

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Resents Marcus's authority but slowly respects his competence. Finds Jillian's scientific approach weird but useful. Actively dislikes Carter (class resentment) until Carter risks himself. Protective of Lisa as a fellow local with real stakes.

**Word count: 282** *(over target, but necessary for Friction Character complexity)*

### LISA THIBODEAUX
**AGE:** 20
**ROLE:** The Believer / The Heart
**APPEARANCE:** Petite with long straight brown hair, pale despite the sun (burns easily), wide dark eyes, wears the resort's waitress uniform (coral polo shirt, white shorts), always has a Saint Christopher medal around her neck (her grandmother's), bites her nails when nervous.

**BACKGROUND:** Local girl, works as waitress at The Gulfview restaurant. Lives with her grandmother in a mobile home park three miles inland. Her mother's mother vanished when Lisa was an infant—"drowned" in 1959, body never found. Raised on her grandmother's stories about the gulf being "alive" and needing respect. Dreams of leaving for college but can't afford it. Saves every tip. Good student in high school, reads constantly, feels trapped by circumstances.

**PERSONALITY:** Quiet, observant, empathetic. Feels others' pain deeply. Believes in things beyond the rational—ghosts, intuition, fate. When she says she "feels" something is wrong, she's usually right. Trusting but not naive—knows people can be cruel. Processes trauma by withdrawing inward. Finds comfort in old stories and rituals. Cries easily but isn't weak—has survived poverty and loss with grace.

**ARC:** Begins afraid of the investigation—doesn't want to know the truth about her grandmother. Lisa's grandmother was labeled "disrespectful" in Cyrus's journal, killed for a perceived slight. Learning the truth is devastating but also freeing. She shifts from passive observer to active participant, insisting on being present for Cyrus's capture. The ambiguous ending—hearing crying from the gulf—leaves her convinced something beyond Cyrus was real.

**SKILLS:** Local knowledge and folklore, emotional intelligence, notices details others miss (people's moods, inconsistencies in stories), genuinely believes in the supernatural which opens investigative angles others dismiss, witnesses the unexplained elements.

**RELATIONSHIPS:** Grateful to Marcus for taking the drownings seriously. Finds Jillian's rationality comforting. Uncomfortable with Carter's flirting but appreciates his help. Bonds with Bobby over shared local roots and understanding of the gulf's power.

## VILLAIN

**NAME:** Cyrus Matthew Wade
**AGE:** 58
**APPEARANCE:** Lean and leathery from decades in the sun, bald with a fringe of gray hair, startlingly pale blue eyes that seem to look through people, neatly trimmed gray beard, missing his left earlobe (diving accident), always wears faded denim shirts and canvas pants, moves with deliberate economy, hands are huge and scarred, speaks softly which makes people lean in to hear him.

**MANNERISMS:** Touches people's shoulders when talking to them (establishing trust, sizing them up). Hums old hymns while working. Refers to the gulf as "she" and "her." Never raises his voice—the softer he speaks, the angrier he is. Compulsively cleans his dive equipment. Keeps his shop and boat obsessively organized. Pauses mid-sentence to "listen" to things others don't hear.

**BACKGROUND:** Born in Emerald Bay, 1921. Navy diver in WWII and Korea, saw combat, witnessed death. Returned home in 1954, married a local woman named Caroline who drowned in 1957 under mysterious circumstances (swimming alone at night, strong swimmer, calm water—sound familiar?). Cyrus found her body. Broke something in him. Started the dive shop in 1965. Became known as helpful, knowledgeable, safe. Locals trusted him completely. Began "hearing" Caroline's voice in the early 1960s. Convinced she speaks through the gulf, guides him to "purify" the waters from disrespectful outsiders.

**PSYCHOLOGY:** Grief-driven delusion reinforced by decades of isolation and religious mania. Genuinely believes he serves a higher purpose. Sees tourists as invaders polluting sacred space. His wife's death was the original trauma; he may have caused it (ambiguous) and reframed his guilt as divine mission. Each killing is a ritual of purification. He feels no remorse—believes he's saving the gulf. Calm and rational in his own framework, which makes him more disturbing than a raving madman.

**METHODS:** Targets tourists who exhibit "disrespectful" behavior—littering, public drunkenness, loud partying, urinating in the gulf. Watches them, learns their patterns. Offers free equipment or advice, establishes trust. Follows them into the water during dusk swims or early morning. Uses his superior diving skills to approach from below. Grabs ankles, drags down, holds underwater until they stop struggling. Strong enough to overpower panicked swimmers. Makes it look accidental. Has been doing this since the early 1960s—dozens of deaths spanning twenty years, all written off as drowning accidents.

**LAIR/DOMAIN:** Lives on a houseboat moored near his dive shop. Interior is obsessively clean except for a hidden shrine behind a false panel—dozens of waterlogged dolls (representing his wife), newspaper clippings of every drowning, journals documenting each killing with dates and "sins" committed. Performs nightly rituals on the boat's deck, speaking to the water.

**WEAKNESS:** Absolute conviction makes him predictable. Believes he's protected by divine purpose, so he's not cautious. When confronted with "bait" matching his criteria, he can't resist. Underwater, he's superior to any single diver, but two working together (Bobby and Marcus) can overwhelm him. His calm confession makes prosecution easy—he wants people to understand his mission.

## MYSTERY MECHANICS

**The Crime:**

Four drownings occur over three weeks in June-July 1979 at Emerald Bay. All victims were strong swimmers found dead in calm, shallow water (waist to chest deep). All have identical bruising on their ankles—distinctive oval marks matching handgrips. Autopsies confirm drowning but can't explain how capable swimmers drowned in perfect conditions. Authorities initially rule them accidents; tourist panic forces deeper investigation. Background research reveals twenty years of similar drownings in the area, 2-3 per summer, always written off as accidents.

**Clue Structure:**

*Major Clues:*
1. **The Bruising Pattern** - Jillian recognizes marks as manual restraint, not environmental. Proves human cause.
2. **The Rental Connection** - All victims rented equipment from Wade's dive shop within 24 hours of death. Establishes link to Cyrus.
3. **The Journals** - Found in houseboat shrine, document twenty years of killings with victim "sins" listed. Confirms premeditation and pattern.
4. **Lisa's Grandmother** - Her name appears in 1959 journals, labeled "disrespectful woman, spoke ill of sacred waters." Personal connection reveals scope.

*Red Herrings:*
1. **The Marine Biology Angle** - Early theory about unknown jellyfish or toxic algae bloom. Scientific dead-end.
2. **The Resort Owner** - Financially benefits from fewer tourists, acts suspiciously evasive. Just worried about lawsuits.
3. **The Hermit** - Local recluse living in abandoned beach house, seen watching swimmers. Just a harmless eccentric.

*Breakthrough Clue:*
Bobby's childhood memory of seeing Cyrus "talking to the water" at night leads to houseboat stakeout, which leads to shrine discovery.

**The Ambiguous Element:**

The saltwater. Cyrus's houseboat develops pools of saltwater on the floor despite no leaks and being moored in calm marina. Forensics can't explain it. When Cyrus drowns in his cell, the sink "overflowed" but plumbing was functional and no one turned it on. Lisa hears weeping from the gulf the night Cyrus dies—others hear nothing. After his death, drownings in the area cease permanently. Was Cyrus a lone killer whose death ended the murders, or was he genuinely serving something that claimed him when he failed? The book never answers. Evidence supports both interpretations.

**Word count: 331** *(target was 280, slightly over but essential mystery info)*

## TONE & VOICE

This novel evokes humid coastal dread—the oppressive weight of Florida summer heat, the deceptive calm of bathwater-warm gulf waters hiding something predatory. Atmospheric priorities: salt smell, sticky humidity, the constant background of small waves and gulls, afternoon thunderstorms rolling in. The gulf itself is a character—beautiful, inviting, and subtly wrong.

Dialogue style is working-class American youth of 1979—casual profanity, regional idioms (Bobby's Cajun-inflected speech, Lisa's soft Southern cadence), technical jargon from Marcus (lifeguard terminology) and Jillian (marine biology). Banter is authentic, not quippy. Tension emerges through what characters don't say—Bobby's resentments, Marcus's guilt, Carter's insecurity.

Pacing is methodical investigation punctuated by visceral drowning scenes and escalating confrontations. Not a thriller sprint but a steady tightening of dread. Emotional tenor: creeping wrongness beneath sunny vacation setting. Think Jaws meets The Wicker Man—beautiful location hiding human evil, with question of something older and darker underneath.

Comparable references: Early Jaws (beach town under siege), The Wicker Man (locals harboring dark secrets), Kolchak: Night Stalker episodes (investigating impossible crimes with rational tools). Prose should feel grounded and observational—Marcus's POV primarily, occasional shifts to Jillian or Bobby for investigative angles. Avoid purple prose; let dread build through accumulating details and unexplained elements.

**Word count: 225** *(target was 180, over but captures essential tone)*

## THEMES

**Small-Town Secrets and Complicity:** How communities protect their own even when suspicions exist. Emerald Bay locals suspected something about Cyrus but never spoke up—he was one of them, drownings hurt tourism, easier to look away. The group of outsiders must solve what locals wouldn't confront.

**Environmental Desecration:** Cyrus's twisted logic about "purifying" the gulf reflects real anxieties about tourism's impact on natural spaces. His murders are deranged extremism born from legitimate grief about disrespect for sacred places. Not endorsing his actions but understanding the wound underneath.

**Grief and Delusion:** How unprocessed trauma warps into violence. Cyrus couldn't accept his wife's death (or his role in it), so he built an elaborate mythology that justified continuing violence. A cautionary tale about grief left to fester.

**The Unknowable:** The gulf as metaphor for things beyond human understanding. Despite investigation and rational explanations, something remains unexplained. The universe resists complete comprehension—some mysteries stay mysteries.
