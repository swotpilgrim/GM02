# Chapter 9: Carter's Bribe

The Escambia County Courthouse sat in the middle of the county seat, a neo-classical monument to bureaucracy built in 1923. Carter parked his Trans Am in visitor parking. Polo shirt—baby blue, collar popped. Khaki slacks. Loafers without socks. The preppy rich kid look that made people either instantly like him or instantly dismiss him as harmless.

Both reactions were useful.

The coroner's office was in the basement annex. Carter had called ahead, claiming to be a journalism student doing research on beach safety. The receptionist had been firm: all records were confidential, no public access without a court order.

So Carter was trying a different approach.

He waited outside the building during lunch hour, watching employees filter out. After twenty minutes, he spotted his target: young guy, early twenties, rumpled business casual, brown bag lunch. Name tag said "David Hernandez - Records Clerk."

Carter intercepted him on the steps.

"Hey, excuse me. You work in the coroner's office?"

David looked up, wary. "Yeah. Who's asking?"

Carter extended his hand. "Carter Whitmore. I know this is weird, but I'm trying to get information about some drowning cases and I'm hitting brick walls. You got a minute?"

"I'm on lunch."

"I'll buy you a better lunch. There's a diner across the street." Carter gestured. "Twenty minutes."

David hesitated, weighing it—stranger danger versus free food versus curiosity. "What kind of information?"

"Autopsy reports. Three drowning victims from Emerald Bay. Last two weeks."

"Those are confidential."

"I know. But I think there's something wrong with how they're being handled, and I need to confirm it. Please. Just talk to me. If you can't help, you can't help. But at least hear me out."

David looked at his brown bag lunch—probably a sad sandwich from home. Looked at the diner across the street where the smell of burgers and fries wafted out. Looked at Carter's earnest face.

"Twenty minutes," David said.

The diner was classic Americana: red vinyl booths, chrome fixtures, a jukebox playing Bee Gees. They slid into a booth and Carter ordered—burgers, fries, milkshakes.

"So what's your angle?" David asked. "You a reporter? Lawyer?"

"Neither. I work at the Sandpiper Beach Resort in Emerald Bay. Three people have drowned there in the past two weeks. All of them in calm water, all experienced swimmers, all under impossible circumstances."

"Drownings happen."

"Not like this. My friend saw bruising on the first victim—grip marks on both ankles. Same marks on the second victim. Probably the third too."

David's expression shifted. Not surprise—recognition.

"You've seen the reports," Carter said.

"I process paperwork. I see a lot of reports."

"These three specifically. What did they say?"

"I can't—"

"I'm not asking you to give me copies. I'm not asking you to break the law. I'm just asking what you saw. Off the record. Human to human." Carter leaned forward. "Three people are dead. If someone's killing them and the official investigation is calling it accidental, more people will die. You know that, right?"

The burgers arrived. David picked at his fries.

"Hypothetically," he said, "if I had seen reports like that, and if those reports had noted unusual contusions on the victims' ankles, and if the attending physician had flagged those as potentially suspicious..."

"But the final ruling was still accidental drowning?"

"Hypothetically, yes."

"Why?"

"Hypothetically? Because the county sheriff's office requested expedited rulings. Tourism concerns. And the county medical examiner signed off on accidental drowning without requiring full autopsies."

"Even with suspicious bruising?"

"The bruising could be explained as environmental trauma. Rocks, debris, struggling against the bottom. Not definitive enough to mandate further investigation. That's what the paperwork would say. Hypothetically."

Carter pulled out his wallet, removed two hundred-dollar bills. Slid them across the table. "I need copies of those reports. All three."

David stared at the money. "That's a felony. Unauthorized access to confidential medical records."

"I know."

"I could lose my job. Face criminal charges."

"I know. But three people are dead, and if you don't help me, there'll be a fourth. And a fifth." Carter kept his voice low. "You saw those bruises. You know they're not environmental trauma. You know something's wrong."

David was quiet. The jukebox switched songs—*Stayin' Alive*.

"Make it three hundred," David said finally.

Carter added another hundred. David pocketed the bills.

"I get off at five. Meet me in the parking garage, second level. I'll have copies. Unofficial copies. Lost in the filing system, never technically released. You didn't get them from me."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just—make sure this matters. Make sure you actually do something with this information."

"I will."

They finished lunch in silence. Carter paid the check and walked back to his car. Three hundred dollars—pocket change to him, a fortune to a records clerk. But worth it for evidence.

---

Five fifteen p.m., Carter sat in his Trans Am on the second level of the parking garage. Mostly empty, echoes bouncing. He'd been waiting ten minutes.

Then footsteps. David appeared from the stairwell, carrying a manila envelope. He looked around, then slid into the passenger seat.

"I made copies during my break. Buried the record. But if this comes back to me—"

"It won't. I promise."

David handed over the envelope. "Three autopsy reports. Preliminary findings. Thomas Harris, Bethany Cross, James Hendricks. All ruled accidental drowning. But look at the notes."

Carter pulled out the reports. Photocopied pages, official letterhead. There, in the "Physical Examination" sections, were notes about ankle contusions.

*Thomas Harris: Bilateral ankle contusions, ovoid pattern, consistent with impact trauma or manual compression. Non-fatal, not causative.*

*Bethany Cross: Bilateral ankle bruising, symmetrical placement, depth suggests significant force application. Etiology uncertain, potentially environmental.*

*James Hendricks: Contusions both ankles, manual-appearing pattern. Unable to definitively rule out ante-mortem restraint.*

"They saw it," Carter breathed. "All three physicians noted the bruising."

"And all three supervisors signed off on accidental drowning anyway." David looked out the window. "There's more. Check the toxicology."

Carter flipped pages. Toxicology screens: negative. No drugs, no alcohol in dangerous quantities.

"Healthy adults," David said. "Good swimmers. Calm water. All three with identical bruising patterns. Tell me that's accidental."

"It's not."

"No. It's not." David finally looked at Carter. "I've worked here eight months. I've processed maybe forty drowning reports in that time—Florida beaches, happens all the time. Never seen three in two weeks from the same location with identical suspicious findings. Never seen that much pressure to expedite rulings. Someone wants this buried."

"The county sheriff?"

"Or whoever the sheriff answers to. Tourism board, county commissioners. Anyone with a financial stake in keeping beach towns thriving." David reached for the door handle. "You need to take this to state police. Or FBI. Someone outside the county."

"We will."

"Good." David stepped out, then leaned back in. "One more thing. The full autopsies that should have been mandated? Canceled. Bodies released to families within forty-eight hours. Evidence destroyed."

Carter felt cold. "Deliberately?"

"Can't prove that. But it's unusually fast. Like someone wanted to make sure no one could take a closer look."

David closed the door and walked away. Carter sat in the car, reports in his lap, processing the implications.

Three murders. Official cover-up. Evidence destroyed.

This was bigger than a serial killer. This was institutional corruption, multiple people deciding dead tourists were acceptable losses as long as the money kept flowing.

Carter started the car and drove back to Emerald Bay, reports locked in his glove compartment, checking his rearview mirror more often than necessary.

If someone was willing to cover up three murders, what would they do to someone trying to expose it?

---

The group convened in the maintenance shed at seven p.m. Carter spread the autopsy reports across the workbench.

Marcus went still. Jillian processed the medical terminology, cross-referencing with what she'd seen at the morgue. Bobby looked sick. Lisa covered her mouth.

"They knew," Marcus said quietly. "Every physician noted suspicious bruising. And their supervisors overruled them."

"This is active suppression," Jillian said. "Expedited rulings, canceled autopsies, bodies released before full examination. Someone is deliberately preventing homicide investigation."

"The sheriff," Bobby said. "Has to be."

"Or whoever's giving the sheriff orders." Carter tapped the reports. "Tourism pressure. County commissioners, maybe the state tourism board. Emerald Bay drownings become a federal investigation, every beach town in the panhandle sees tourism dry up. Millions in lost revenue."

"So they let people die," Lisa said, voice shaking. "They let someone murder tourists because investigating would hurt business."

"Yes."

Marcus gathered the reports carefully. "This is evidence of conspiracy. Criminal negligence at minimum, possibly accessory to murder. We take this to state police tomorrow."

"What if state police are in on it too?" Bobby challenged.

"Then we go to the FBI. Or the newspapers. Or both." Marcus's jaw was tight. "We have documentary evidence. Three autopsy reports showing consistent suspicious findings and official pressure to suppress. We have Jillian's photos. We have witness statements. We have a pattern going back decades. This is enough to force an investigation."

"Is it enough to catch the killer?" Lisa asked. "Because all this bureaucratic corruption doesn't tell us who's actually drowning people."

She was right. They had proof of cover-up but not proof of perpetrator. The killer was still out there, still hunting, still protected by official indifference and local folklore.

"We work both angles," Marcus said. "Tomorrow I call state police, report the murders and the cover-up. Meanwhile we continue identifying suspects. Someone local with diving skills who's been operating for decades. We narrow the list, we find them."

They divided up tasks. Carter would make copies of the autopsy reports—backups in case the originals were seized. Jillian would develop her morgue photos, create documentation. Bobby and Lisa would continue researching local suspects and historical patterns. Marcus would handle state police notification.

As they filed out, Carter hung back with Marcus.

"You know this is dangerous now, right?" Carter said. "If someone's covering up three murders and we're threatening to expose it, we're targets."

"I know."

"We're college kids playing detective. We're out of our depth."

"We're also the only ones who care enough to do anything." Marcus looked at the reports. "Three people dead. Families destroyed. And the people who should be investigating are actively preventing it. Yeah, it's dangerous. But what's the alternative?"

Carter had no answer.

They locked the shed and went their separate ways. Carter drove back to the resort, reports hidden under the seat, wondering when he'd gone from bored rich kid to amateur investigator risking criminal charges.

Probably around the time he realized people were dying and nobody with power gave a damn.

Well, he gave a damn now.

And he had three hundred dollars worth of proof to prove it.
