# Chapter 5: Impossible Circumstances

Marcus was hypervigilant.

Four days after the second drowning, he'd turned the lifeguard tower into a command post. Polaroid camera. Binoculars. A notebook logging every swimmer—time in, time out, description, behavior. Carter called it his "obsession station," but Marcus didn't care.

Two people had died on his watch.

The afternoon was perfect. Low nineties, offshore breeze, the gulf calm as glass. Visibility thirty feet down. Perfect swimming conditions.

And Marcus was watching.

The beach had maybe a dozen people. Tourism had crashed. Word spreads fast—*Two drownings in a week*. Most families had checked out.

Marcus watched a family. Father, mother, teenage son. Typical Midwestern tourists. The father wore Ohio State swim trunks. The mother had a floppy sun hat. The kid wore cut-offs and a Lynyrd Skynyrd t-shirt.

Now all three were in the water. Waist-deep, maybe chest-deep on the mother. The father was big—six-two, easily two hundred pounds. Former athlete, Marcus guessed. The kind who swam in college.

Marcus checked his watch: 2:47 PM. Logged it. *Family of three, Ohio plates, entered water 2:35 PM. Father approx 6'2", athletic build. Calm conditions. Clear visibility.*

He scanned the rest of the beach. Two girls sunbathing. An older couple reading. A man with a metal detector.

Everything normal.

Marcus swung the binoculars back to the family. The mother was laughing at something the father said. The kid was practicing underwater swimming, diving down and popping back up. Normal vacation behavior.

The father went under.

No splash. No shout. No struggle. One second he was standing there, water at chest level, and the next second he was just... gone. Straight down like something had yanked him.

Marcus was on his feet, whistle in mouth, blowing three sharp blasts. He grabbed the rescue float and was running before his brain fully processed what he'd seen.

The mother was screaming.

Marcus hit the water at full sprint, diving forward into the shallows. The gulf closed over his head—warm, clear, silent. He kicked hard, eyes open.

There.

The father was eight feet down, sinking slowly in the perfect water. Arms floating loosely. Not struggling. Not moving.

Marcus dove deeper, lungs already burning. He grabbed the man under the arms—deadweight, so heavy—and kicked for the surface. His legs screamed with effort. The rescue float helped with buoyancy but the man was massive, and Marcus had to fight for every foot.

They broke the surface together. Marcus gasped for air, maintaining his grip, sidestroking toward shore.

"Help me!" The mother was wading toward them, hysterical. The son was frozen in shock.

Marcus got the father into shallower water, dragged him onto the sand. The man's face was blue-tinged. Lips slack. Eyes closed. Not breathing.

Training took over. Marcus tilted the head back, checked the airway—clear. Started compressions. The rhythm was automatic: thirty compressions, two breaths. The man's chest rose and fell with the rescue breaths but no spontaneous breathing.

People were gathering. Someone was shouting about calling 911. The mother was on her knees, sobbing. The son stood motionless, staring at his father's body.

"Come on," Marcus muttered between compressions. "Come on, breathe."

Thirty compressions. Two breaths. Thirty compressions. Two breaths.

This was impossible. Marcus had watched it happen. The man had been standing in chest-deep water, clear visibility, calm conditions. Nobody nearby. He'd just gone straight down like an anchor.

Carter arrived, out of breath. "Ambulance is coming."

Marcus kept working. His arms were burning. Sweat dripped into his eyes despite the gulf breeze. Five minutes of CPR. Six. Seven.

The man was dead. Had been dead, probably, from the moment he went under. Just like Tom Harris. Just like Bethany Cross.

At ten minutes, Marcus sat back, breathing hard. The mother let out a wail that cut through every rational thought in his mind. The son finally moved, kneeling beside his father, touching his shoulder like he could wake him up.

"I'm sorry," Marcus said. The words felt hollow.

The sheriff's deputy arrived before the ambulance—same guy, Collins. He looked tired. And annoyed.

"Again?" Collins surveyed the scene. "This is the third in two weeks."

"I saw it happen," Marcus said. His voice shook with adrenaline and frustration. "I was watching him. Directly watching. He went under like something pulled him."

"Something pulled him."

"Yes."

Collins wrote in his notebook. "And what do you think pulled him, Mr. Chen? A shark? A giant squid?"

"I don't know. But he didn't just drown. The water was clear. I could see the bottom. There was no one else near him. He went straight down."

"People have medical emergencies. Heart attack, stroke, seizure. Makes them sink."

"Then why does this keep happening?"

Collins closed his notebook. "Mr. Chen, I understand you're upset. You're the lifeguard, you feel responsible. But people drown. It's a statistical reality. Three drownings in two weeks is unusual, yes. But not impossible. And without evidence of foul play—"

"I have evidence." Marcus stood, walked to his bag, pulled out the Polaroid of Tom Harris's ankles. "The first victim. Look at the bruising."

Collins glanced at it. "Could be from hitting rocks underwater."

"Those are grip marks. Someone grabbed him."

"Or he grabbed something trying to save himself. Reef, rocks, debris." Collins handed the photo back. "Look, son. I know this is hard. But you're seeing patterns that aren't there. Three drownings, three different circumstances, three different people. Sometimes bad things just happen."

Marcus wanted to argue but the ambulance was pulling in, and the family needed attention. He watched as EMTs confirmed the death, loaded the body, tried to comfort the mother and son. Watched as Collins took statements, ruled it another accidental drowning, went through the bureaucratic motions.

And he watched as nobody—not the deputy, not the EMTs, not anyone—examined the body carefully enough to see what Marcus knew he'd find.

That night, Marcus couldn't sleep.

He lay in Room 24, ceiling fan turning slowly overhead, replaying the drowning in his mind. He'd been watching. His eyes had been locked on that family. The father had been standing there, and then he'd gone under. Straight down. No flailing, no gasping, just down.

Like something had grabbed his ankles and pulled.

Around midnight, Marcus gave up on sleep. He pulled on jeans and a t-shirt, grabbed his flashlight, and walked to the beach.

The gulf was different at night. The cheerful daytime blue became black, endless, unknowable. Small waves whispered against the sand. The pier stretched out into darkness, lit by a few scattered lights that created pools of illumination on the water.

Marcus walked to where the drowning had happened. The sand still showed impressions from the emergency response—footprints, the drag marks where they'd pulled the body ashore, darker patches where water had soaked the beach.

He stood at the waterline and looked out at the black gulf.

"What are you?" he whispered to the water. "What's out there?"

The waves didn't answer. They never did.

A sound made him turn. Jillian was walking across the beach, carrying her shoes, wearing a Florida State hoodie over shorts.

"Couldn't sleep either?" she asked, stopping next to him.

"Keep seeing it. He was just standing there, and then..." Marcus gestured helplessly. "Gone."

"I know." Jillian hugged herself against the night chill. "I keep thinking about Bethany. Finding her. Pulling her out. She was so young."

They stood in silence, watching the dark water.

"I examined the body," Marcus said finally. "The father. Before the EMTs took him."

"And?"

"Same bruising. Both ankles. Oval patterns, perfect grip marks." He pulled the flashlight from his pocket, clicked it on, aimed the beam at the water. It penetrated maybe ten feet before diffusing into murky nothing. "Someone is drowning people. Someone with underwater capability, knowledge of these waters, and no conscience whatsoever."

"How?" Jillian asked. "That's what I can't figure out. Even with scuba gear, how would you approach someone in waist-deep water, grab them, pull them down, and drown them without being seen? The water's clear. The beach has people. It's impossible."

"But it's happening."

"I know." Jillian was quiet for a moment. "Unless..."

"Unless what?"

"What if they're not approaching from offshore? What if they're already there, waiting? Buried in the sand or hiding under the pier pilings until a target enters the water?"

Marcus considered it. "Possible. But they'd still be visible when they struck. And victims would fight, thrash, alert others."

"Unless the attack is so fast and decisive that by the time anyone notices, it's over. Grab the ankles, pull hard, victim goes under in shock, can't call out because their mouth fills with water. Thirty seconds, maybe sixty, and it's done. Victim unconscious from lack of oxygen. Attacker retreats underwater. By the time rescuers arrive, there's just a body and no sign of what happened."

It made horrible sense. Marcus ran through the timeline of each drowning. Tom Harris: wife looked away for "a second, maybe two." Bethany Cross: swimming alone at dusk, no witnesses. Today's victim: standing with his family, went under, Marcus reached him within thirty seconds. All fit the pattern of a lightning-fast ambush.

"We need to see the body," Marcus said. "Today's victim. Before they transport him to the funeral home. If he has the same ankle bruising, it's definitive proof."

Jillian checked her watch. "It's almost one a.m. Body's probably at the county morgue by now. My friend Tim works there—the one who let me examine Bethany. But I can't ask him again. He was already suspicious."

"Then we don't ask. We just go."

"That's illegal. That's breaking and entering, tampering with evidence, probably half a dozen felonies."

"Three people are dead, Jillian. And more will die if we don't stop this." Marcus met her eyes. "I know how this sounds. I know we're just summer workers at a beach resort, not cops or investigators. But nobody else is taking this seriously. It's up to us."

Jillian bit her lip, thinking. Finally: "Tomorrow night. I'll figure out when Tim's not on shift. We go in, document the bruising with your Polaroid, get out. Quietly. Quickly. No trace."

"Tomorrow night," Marcus agreed.

They walked back toward the resort together, footprints filling with water behind them in the dark sand. Above, stars filled the sky, infinite and indifferent. And behind them, the gulf whispered its secrets to the night, patient and hungry.

Somewhere in the darkness, a killer was waiting for the next victim.

But now Marcus knew what to look for. And he was going to find them.
