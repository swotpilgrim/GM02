# Chapter 11: Victim Profiles

Jillian spread the photocopied newspaper clippings across the resort lobby coffee table.

"Let's start with what we know." She organized three stacks—one for each victim. "Tom Harris, Bethany Cross, James Hendricks. All drowned. All had ankle bruising. All rented from Wade's dive shop. But why these three specifically?"

Lisa sat across from her, notepad ready. The lobby was quiet—nine a.m., most guests at breakfast.

"We need to understand who they were," Jillian continued. "What did they do before they died? How did they behave?"

"You think the killer chose them for a reason?"

"Serial killers always have reasons. Sometimes they're insane reasons, but they're there. If we find the pattern in victim selection, we understand the killer's psychology."

Lisa pulled the first stack closer. Tom Harris. Photocopied article from the Pensacola News Journal: *Atlanta Businessman Drowns in Emerald Bay.*

"Harris was here for a corporate retreat," Lisa said, reading. "Advertising executive. Mid-forties, married, two kids. No known medical conditions."

"What about behavior?" Jillian asked. "Did anyone see him before he drowned?"

"We could ask other guests. Some are still here from that week."

They found Mrs. Patterson in the dining room, elderly woman from Tallahassee. She remembered Tom Harris clearly.

"Loud man," she said, sipping coffee. "Very opinionated. Complained about everything—room size, food quality, water temperature. Called it a 'third-rate dump.'"

"Did you see him at the beach?" Jillian asked.

"Oh yes. Said it was trashy compared to the Carolinas. I saw him throw beer cans in the water. Multiple cans. His wife looked embarrassed."

Lisa wrote this down. "Did anyone confront him?"

"A local man said something. I don't recall exactly. Mr. Harris told him to mind his business, used some colorful language." Mrs. Patterson's mouth pursed in disapproval. "He was not a respectful gentleman."

They found two more witnesses who'd interacted with Tom Harris. Both confirmed: loud, obnoxious, careless with trash, dismissive of locals. One guest specifically remembered Harris calling the Gulf of Mexico "disgusting" and "like swimming in bathtub water."

Jillian and Lisa moved to the second victim.

Bethany Cross had been staying at a different hotel—a cheaper place two miles south, spring break destination. They drove there, found the manager willing to talk.

"I remember her group," the manager said. Young, maybe thirty, exhausted. "Ten college kids, FSU spring break trip. They were... energetic."

"Energetic," Jillian repeated.

"Drunk. Constantly drunk. Loud parties, noise complaints, property damage. I was ready to evict them when the drowning happened."

"What about Bethany specifically?"

The manager shrugged. "Hard to say. They were all kind of the same. Drunk girls in bikinis, drunk boys being idiots. No respect for property, no respect for other guests."

They found members of Bethany's spring break group still in the area, haunting local bars. Three girls in a booth at Sharky's Bar, nursing drinks at ten a.m.

"We just want to understand what happened," Lisa said. "We're looking into the drownings."

The girls exchanged glances. "Beth was wasted that day. We all were. It was spring break. We were supposed to be having fun."

"Did she do anything unusual before she drowned?"

Another girl laughed bitterly. "You mean besides pee in the ocean? Yeah, she did that. We all did. Drunk girls, warm water, no bathrooms nearby. She thought it was hilarious."

"Was anyone watching? Did anyone react?"

"Some old guy on the beach. Local, I think. He yelled at us. Called us disrespectful. Beth flipped him off, said it was a free country. He got really mad, but we just laughed and moved down the beach."

Jillian felt cold. "What did this man look like?"

"I don't know. Older, maybe fifties? Tan, weathered. Looked like every beach townie. Why?"

"Just wondering. Was this right before Beth drowned?"

"Maybe an hour before? We were drunk. Time's fuzzy."

They thanked the girls and left. Lisa was quiet until they reached the car.

"Bethany urinated in the water and an older local man confronted her about disrespect," Lisa said. "An hour later she's dead with bruises on her ankles."

"Could be coincidence," Jillian said, but her voice lacked conviction.

"Could be. Let's check the third victim."

James Hendricks had been staying at the Sandpiper—their resort. They had access to guest records, incident reports, staff notes. Jillian pulled his file from Kowalski's office while the manager was at lunch.

Two incident reports. First: noise complaint from room next door. Second: confrontation with maintenance staff about littering.

Bobby had filed the second report.

They found Bobby at the maintenance shed, on his lunch break, eating a sandwich.

"James Hendricks," Jillian said. "You filed an incident report about him."

Bobby nodded, swallowing. "Yeah. June 14. Day before he drowned. Caught him leaving beer bottles on the beach. Not in a trash can, just left them in the sand. I told him to pick them up, use the provided receptacles. He told me to fuck off, it wasn't his job."

"What happened?"

"I picked them up myself. Logged the incident. Kowalski doesn't like confrontations with guests, so I just documented it and moved on."

"Was anyone else there?"

Bobby thought. "Yeah, actually. Cyrus."

Jillian's pulse quickened. "Cyrus Wade?"

"He was walking past, saw the confrontation. Came over and backed me up. Told Hendricks the gulf deserved respect, not trash. Hendricks got hostile, said we were both local hicks with nothing better to do than harass tourists. Cyrus got... intense. Not physically aggressive, but verbally. Said people who desecrated the waters would answer for it. Hendricks laughed at him."

"And the next day Hendricks drowned," Lisa said quietly.

Bobby set down his sandwich, appetite gone. "Jesus. You think Cyrus killed him because he littered?"

"We think Cyrus killed him because he showed disrespect," Jillian corrected. "The littering was just evidence of that disrespect."

They returned to the resort lobby, added the new information to their notes.

Three victims. Three instances of disrespectful behavior toward the gulf waters.

Tom Harris: threw trash in the water, called it disgusting.

Bethany Cross: urinated in the water, laughed when confronted.

James Hendricks: littered on the beach, dismissed local concerns.

"It's a pattern," Lisa said. "Not a coincidence. He's selecting victims based on behavior."

"Environmental extremism," Jillian said. "Or moral punishment. He sees the gulf as sacred, sees himself as its protector. Tourists who desecrate it deserve death."

"That's insane."

"To us. To him, it's righteous."

Jillian pulled out a psychology textbook from the library. "Mission-oriented killers believe they're serving a higher purpose. Cleaning up society, punishing sinners. They don't see themselves as murderers. They're executioners."

Lisa wrapped her arms around herself. "My grandmother. The story Evangeline told—Marie said something disrespectful about the gulf water quality. Someone overheard. Days later she drowned."

"Same pattern. Same motive. If it's the same killer, he's been operating this way for decades."

"But Cyrus Wade would've been a teenager in 1959."

"Old enough. Sixteen, seventeen. Plenty of serial killers start young." Jillian flipped through the textbook. "Especially if they experienced formative trauma connected to their mission. Something that made them see the gulf as sacred, worthy of violent protection."

"You're profiling him."

"Attempting to. White male, local, connected to the water through livelihood and lifestyle. Diver, boat owner, knows the currents and tides. Probably experienced environmental degradation firsthand—pollution, overfishing, destruction of reefs. Develops pathological attachment to the gulf, personifies it as female, sees himself as protector or avenger."

"Bobby said Cyrus calls the gulf 'she' and 'her,'" Lisa remembered. "Talks about it like it's a living thing. Gets genuinely angry when people litter or treat it carelessly."

"Lots of locals do that. Doesn't make them killers."

"No. But combined with everything else..." Jillian arranged the evidence: geographic pattern, rental connection, victim behavior pattern, psychological profile. "He fits. Perfectly."

The lobby door opened. Carter entered, looked around, spotted them, walked over.

"Marcus is at the dive shop now," Carter said. "Rented a snorkel set, playing tourist. I've got visual from the diner across the street. Cyrus seemed normal so far—friendly, helpful, safety-conscious. Textbook good business owner."

"Of course he does," Jillian said. "He's been hiding in plain sight for twenty years. He's careful."

"You find something?"

Lisa showed him the notes. "All three victims exhibited disrespectful behavior toward the gulf before they died. Littering, pollution, verbal dismissiveness. Cyrus was present or aware of at least two instances—Bethany's confrontation with a local, Hendricks's littering argument."

Carter read through the notes, expression darkening. "So he's not just killing randomly. He's punishing people. Environmental vigilante serial killer."

"Essentially."

"That's..." Carter searched for words. "That's deeply fucked up."

"Yes."

"But it gives us motive. Means. Opportunity. Selection criteria. We know why he kills, how he picks victims, what triggers him." Carter looked at Jillian. "Does this help us stop him?"

"If we know his triggers, we can predict who he'll target next. Who's been disrespectful recently? Who's done something that would catch his attention?"

They looked at each other.

"Half the tourists here," Lisa said. "People are careless all the time. Littering, peeing in the water, throwing trash. It's constant."

"So he has endless targets," Carter said. "Question is—who's next on his list?"

"Someone who rented from him recently," Jillian said. "Someone he observed being disrespectful. Someone who fits his criteria."

Carter checked his watch. "It's June 16. Based on the pattern—deaths on June 8, 12, and 15—we predicted June 18 for the next one. Two days."

"If he sticks to the pattern."

"And if he doesn't escalate," Lisa added. "Three kills in a week. That's not normal pacing for a serial killer."

"Nothing about this is normal," Jillian said. She gathered the notes, the newspaper clippings, the psychological profile. "We need to get this to Marcus. He's in proximity to Cyrus right now, unarmed, vulnerable. If Cyrus suspects anything..."

"Marcus knows the risks," Carter said. "But yeah, let's regroup. Share what we found."

They stood to leave. Jillian paused, looking down at the photograph of Bethany Cross in the newspaper clipping. Young, smiling, alive. Reduced to a cautionary tale about spring break excess.

"She was drunk and stupid," Jillian said quietly. "That's not a death sentence. None of them deserved this."

"No," Lisa agreed. "But Cyrus Wade thinks they did. And that makes him more dangerous than any random killer. He believes he's right."

They walked out into the June heat, carrying evidence of a man who'd turned environmental protection into murder, righteousness into serial killing, and the Gulf of Mexico into a burial ground for sinners.

Somewhere across town, Marcus was smiling at that man, taking equipment from his hands, preparing to swim in waters the man considered sacred.

And somewhere in Cyrus Wade's mind, calculations were being made. Judgments rendered. Sentences passed.

The gulf would be pure.

No matter how many had to drown to make it so.
