# Chapter 12: The Dive

"I need you to dive with me," Marcus said.

Bobby looked up from the workbench where he was organizing dive equipment. "Where?"

"The three drowning sites. I need to see what's down there. Understand the underwater terrain, look for evidence."

"You're certified?"

"Advanced Open Water. Fifty logged dives." Marcus had learned in college, California coast mostly, cold water and kelp forests. Nothing like the Gulf, but the principles were the same.

Bobby considered this. "Why me?"

"Because you know these waters. You've been diving here your whole life. I could miss something a local would spot immediately."

"And you think there's something to find?"

"I think if Cyrus has been drowning people for twenty years, he's got a system. A method. And methods leave evidence."

Bobby set down the regulator he'd been cleaning. His hands were shaking slightly. "If we rent from Cyrus, he'll know we're diving the drowning sites. That's suspicious."

"Not if we're smart about it. We tell him we want to see the local reef, check out the marine life. He doesn't have to know exactly where we're going."

"And if he follows us?"

"Then we surface and abort. But we have to try."

Bobby was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Okay. Let's go."

Wade's Gulf Diving sat on the main road, painted sea-foam green with a wooden sign shaped like a manta ray. The windows displayed rental equipment, certification posters, photos of happy divers with fish.

Marcus and Bobby entered. A bell chimed. The shop smelled like neoprene and salt water.

Cyrus Wade stood behind the counter.

Marcus had seen him from a distance before—Bobby had pointed him out once. But up close, Cyrus looked nothing like a serial killer.

Mid-fifties, deeply tanned, weathered in the way people who spend their lives on the water get weathered. Salt-and-pepper hair pulled back in a ponytail. Kind eyes, laugh lines. Wearing a faded dive shop t-shirt and cargo shorts. He looked like someone's uncle. Someone's grandfather.

"Bobby!" Cyrus's face lit up. "Haven't seen you in here in months. Finally taking a day off from that resort?"

"Hey, Cyrus." Bobby's voice was carefully neutral. "My friend Marcus wants to check out the local reefs. Thought I'd show him around."

Cyrus extended his hand to Marcus. Firm grip, calloused palms. "Marcus. Welcome. First time in Emerald Bay?"

"First time diving it. I'm certified, but California coast mostly."

"Oh, you'll love it here. Warmer water, better visibility, beautiful marine life. The Gulf gets a bad rap, but she's gorgeous when you know where to look." Cyrus pulled out a rental form. "What do you need? Full setup or just tanks?"

"Full setup for me," Marcus said. "Bobby's got his own gear."

"Good man. Let's get you fitted."

For the next twenty minutes, Cyrus was the picture of professionalism. He measured Marcus for a wetsuit, tested regulators, explained local conditions. He warned about currents that didn't exist, suggested dive spots that were safe for beginners, gave tips on buoyancy in warm water.

He was knowledgeable. Patient. Genuinely enthusiastic about diving.

Marcus felt cognitive dissonance settling in. This man had taught Bobby to dive as a kid. Ran safety classes for free. Talked about the Gulf with reverence and love.

Could this man grab people's ankles and hold them underwater until they drowned?

"You boys be careful out there," Cyrus said as he loaded gear into Marcus's arms. "Stay within your limits, watch your air, buddy system at all times. The gulf is beautiful, but she demands respect. You give her that, she'll give you wonders."

"We will," Marcus said. "Thanks."

As they left, Cyrus called out: "Bobby—come by for dinner sometime. Your mama too. Haven't seen you both in too long."

Bobby nodded without speaking and pushed through the door.

Outside, in the parking lot, Marcus looked at him. "You okay?"

"He called my mother by name. He's been to our house. He fixed our water heater for free last winter." Bobby loaded gear into his truck. "And we're about to prove he's a serial killer."

They drove in silence to the beach.

---

The water was bathwater warm, visibility maybe thirty feet. Marcus descended slowly, equalizing pressure, following Bobby down.

The first drowning site was marked in Marcus's waterproof notebook—coordinates, depth, description. Tom Harris had died here. Chest-deep water, about ten feet down, sandy bottom with patches of seagrass.

Bobby signaled: *Look around.*

Marcus swam in a slow circle, scanning the bottom. Sand, shells, small fish darting through the grass. Nothing unusual. Nothing that would explain how someone could ambush a swimmer in broad daylight.

Bobby dove deeper, into the seagrass patch. His movements were practiced, efficient. He'd been diving these waters since he was twelve. He knew every rock, every current, every hiding spot.

He stopped. Signaled Marcus over.

In the seagrass, nearly invisible unless you were looking for it, was a rope. Nylon, weather-worn, weighted at one end with a dive weight. The other end tied to a limestone rock formation that jutted from the sand.

Bobby pulled it taut. Maybe fifteen feet long. The weight kept it anchored. The seagrass concealed it perfectly.

Marcus understood immediately.

Tie off here. Wait in the grass, submerged, invisible from above. Watch swimmers. When a target enters the water, surface quietly, grab their ankles, pull down fast, drag them to the bottom. Hold them until they stop struggling. Let the current carry them, surface elsewhere, swim back to shore unnoticed.

The rope was an ambush point.

Bobby's eyes above his mask were wide. He gestured: *Next site.*

---

The second drowning site had one too. Different location, same setup. Weighted rope, concealed in underwater vegetation, positioned at the edge of deeper water.

The third site confirmed it. Three ropes. Three ambush points. All within the quarter-mile drowning zone.

Marcus surfaced near the pier, Bobby beside him. They swam to shore in silence, stripped their gear in silence, loaded the truck in silence.

It wasn't until they were back at the maintenance shed, door locked, that Bobby spoke.

"It's him." His voice was hollow. "Cyrus is drowning them."

Marcus laid out the waterproof camera he'd brought. Three photos, one from each site, showing the concealed ropes.

"These are deliberate," Marcus said. "Positioned for maximum concealment, optimal depth, current advantage. Whoever set these up knows underwater terrain intimately. Has equipment. Has time. Has capability."

"And Cyrus has all of that." Bobby sat heavily on a stool. "He dives every day. Knows every inch of the bottom. Could set these ropes at night, maintain them, use them whenever he wanted."

"The question is how long have they been there?"

"Could be weeks. Could be years. Nylon rope lasts underwater. He could've had these in place for a decade." Bobby stared at the photos. "I learned to dive from a serial killer."

"You didn't know."

"Didn't I?" Bobby's voice rose. "Everyone talks about the drownings. The pattern. The legend. And Cyrus is the most vocal person in town about respecting the gulf, about tourists ruining it, about people needing to be taught lessons. I heard him say it a hundred times. How did I not see?"

"Because he hid it. Because he's good at hiding."

"He called my mother by name, Marcus. He's been in my house. He gave me my first dive knife as a birthday present. He taught me to navigate by compass, to clear a flooded mask, to respect the water." Bobby's hands were shaking. "And he's been murdering people the entire time I've known him."

Marcus had no comfort to offer. This was the cost of truth—sometimes it shattered everything you thought you knew about your world.

"We have evidence now," Marcus said. "Physical evidence. The ropes, the rental logs, the victim profiles. We take it to state police tomorrow, file a formal report, force an investigation."

"You think they'll believe us?"

"They have to. This isn't speculation anymore. We have documentation."

Bobby looked at the three photos laid out like accusations. "What if he knows? What if he saw us diving those sites? What if he's planning to—"

"We're careful from here on. We don't go anywhere alone. We don't swim. We stay visible, stay together."

"And if he comes after us anyway?"

Marcus met his eyes. "Then we stop him. By whatever means necessary."

The shed was quiet. Outside, the sun was setting, painting the sky orange and pink. Tourist families were heading to dinner, laughing about sunburns and seashells. Normal vacation sounds. Innocent sounds.

And somewhere in that Norman Rockwell scene, Cyrus Wade was probably closing up his dive shop, smiling at customers, offering friendly advice about dive conditions.

A monster who looked like everyone's favorite uncle.

"I need to tell my mother," Bobby said suddenly. "She still talks to Cyrus. Goes to him for help with house repairs. If he's dangerous, if he suspects we're onto him—she could be at risk."

"Tell her. Tell her to stay away from him until this is resolved."

"She'll ask why."

"Then tell her the truth. She deserves to know."

Bobby stood, gathered the photos. "My whole life I've heard the legend. La Llorona del Golfo. The weeping woman who drowns sinners. Turns out it was just a man. A cruel, calculating man who hid behind folklore and community trust." He looked at Marcus. "Which is worse? A ghost killing randomly, or a human killing deliberately?"

"The human. Because we can stop him."

"Can we?"

"We have to."

Bobby left, carrying the photos like evidence at a trial. Marcus stayed in the shed, looking at his own notes. Three weighted ropes. Three ambush points. A system refined over decades.

How many people had Cyrus Wade drowned using these ropes? How many tourists had rented his equipment, taken his advice, swum in his favorite spots, never knowing they'd been selected for death?

Dozens, Marcus suspected. Maybe more.

All hidden behind a friendly smile and reverent talk about respecting the sacred waters.

Marcus locked up the shed and walked back to the resort. The gulf stretched out before him, darkening as night fell. The water that had seemed so beautiful when he'd arrived now looked menacing. Hungry.

And tomorrow they'd take their evidence to authorities who'd ignored this for twenty years. Who'd let a killer operate because investigating would hurt tourism.

Would they listen now?

Marcus didn't know.

But he was going to make them try.

The alternative—letting Cyrus Wade drown one more person—was unacceptable.

The hunt was ending.

And one way or another, the drownings would stop.
