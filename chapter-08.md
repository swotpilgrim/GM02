# Chapter 8: Jillian's Examination

The Escambia County Morgue was forty miles from Emerald Bay, a squat concrete building that looked like abandoned brutalism.

Jillian had called ahead, catching Tim during lunch. They'd met at a marine biology conference two years ago. He was doing a gap year at the morgue before med school, and he owed her a favor.

"This is highly irregular," Tim said, leading her through the back entrance. Gangly, all elbows, wearing oversized scrubs. "I could lose my job."

"I know. I'm sorry. But this is important."

"Marine biology research on drowning victims?"

"Potential toxic bloom. Jellyfish. Anything explaining sudden incapacitation in clear water."

Tim pushed through double doors into the examination room. Cold, clinical, reeking of formaldehyde. Three examination tables, empty. A wall of refrigerated lockers.

"Which one?" Jillian asked.

"Third from the left. Bottom row. Female, early twenties. Came in two days ago." Tim checked a clipboard. "Bethany Cross. Ruled accidental drowning pending final autopsy."

He opened the locker, slid out the drawer. The body was covered with a white sheet, toe tag visible. Tim pulled back the sheet to reveal Bethany's face—pale, waxy, eyes closed. Someone had cleaned her up. She looked peaceful.

Jillian swallowed hard. This was different from marine specimens. This had been a person.

"I need to see the ankles."

Tim pulled the sheet back further. Bethany's legs were pale, mottled. But on both ankles, clear as day, were the bruises. Dark oval marks, symmetrical.

Jillian pulled out her camera—a 35mm Canon with high-speed film. She took photos from multiple angles, close-ups of the bruising pattern.

"Those are unusual," Tim said, leaning in. "I noticed them during intake but the attending didn't mention them in the preliminary report."

"What do they look like to you?"

Tim examined them. "Contusions consistent with grip pressure. Finger spacing, thumb placement. Significant force—deep bruises." He looked up. "Someone grabbed her. Hard."

"Could it be from rocks, debris?"

"No. Pattern's too uniform, too symmetrical. Bilateral manual restraint. Large hands. Strong." Tim's expression shifted. "This looks like homicide evidence."

"I know."

"Does the sheriff know?"

"The sheriff dismissed similar marks on the previous victim as environmental trauma."

"Jesus." Tim pulled the sheet back up. "How many?"

"Three deaths in two weeks. All with identical ankle bruising."

Tim was quiet. Finally: "You need to see the wrists too."

He pulled the sheet down, lifted Bethany's right arm. Her wrist showed faint abrasions. Left wrist—same. Minor scraping.

"Defensive wounds?" Jillian asked.

"Possibly. Or struggling while restrained. If someone grabbed her ankles and she tried to pry their hands off..." He stopped. "This is beyond my clearance. We should call the police."

"The police won't listen."

"Then the medical examiner. State police. Someone."

Jillian took more photos—wrists, body position, ankle bruising from different angles. "I will. But I need documentation first."

Tim helped her, moving the body carefully. They worked in silence. When Jillian exhausted her film, Tim returned Bethany to the locker, sliding the drawer closed with a metallic click.

"Cause of death is definitely drowning," Tim said, washing his hands. "Water in lungs, classic presentation. But the aspiration pattern suggests she was conscious when she went under. Conscious and fighting."

"How can you tell?"

"Amount and distribution of water in the respiratory system. Someone unconscious has different aspiration than someone struggling for air while being held underwater. She fought. She knew she was drowning." Tim dried his hands. "Terrible way to die."

Jillian felt sick. She'd been thinking clinically—patterns, evidence. But Bethany had struggled for air, fought to live. Her last moments had been terror and the horrible realization that someone was killing her.

"Thank you," Jillian said quietly. "For letting me see this."

"Don't thank me. Just—promise you'll take this to someone who can do something. This is murder, Jillian. Clear as day. Someone needs to stop whoever's doing this before there's a fourth victim."

"I promise."

---

The drive back to Emerald Bay took forty minutes. Jillian organized her thoughts, shifting from emotional to analytical.

Facts: Bethany Cross was manually restrained by the ankles and forcibly drowned while conscious. She fought her attacker, evidenced by defensive wounds. The ME's office was pressured to rule it accidental, or wasn't looking closely enough.

Pattern: Three victims, three sets of identical ankle bruising, three drownings in perfect conditions.

Evidence: Photographic documentation, medical testimony from Tim, the physics of manual drowning.

Jillian pulled into the Sandpiper lot just after three. The resort looked even more deserted—maybe ten cars total, half probably staff.

She found Marcus in his tower, binoculars scanning the water methodically. He looked down when she called his name.

"How'd it go?"

"We need to talk. Get the others."

Twenty minutes later they were gathered in Bobby's maintenance shed—their unofficial headquarters for an unofficial investigation. Jillian spread the Polaroids she'd taken across the workbench. The 35mm film was at a one-hour photo place in town; she'd pick it up tomorrow.

"Manual restraint, both ankles, significant force," Jillian said, clinical and precise. "My friend Tim—he's a med tech at the morgue—confirmed the bruising is consistent with someone grabbing and holding. The pattern matches human hands, large hands, strong grip. He estimated the attacker has to be strong enough to overpower an adult swimmer while underwater."

Marcus leaned over the photos. "That's definitive. That's proof."

"It gets worse. Bethany had defensive wounds on her wrists. Minor abrasions, but Tim thinks they're from fighting while being held. And the drowning itself—water aspiration patterns show she was conscious when she went under. She fought. She knew what was happening."

Lisa's hand went to her mouth. Carter looked away. Bobby stared at the photos with an expression of cold fury.

"That's torture," Bobby said. "That's not just murder, that's making someone know they're dying. Making them suffer."

"Yes," Jillian said. "And here's what really damns the official investigation: Tim said this is obvious homicide evidence. Any competent medical examiner would see it immediately. But the preliminary report listed no suspicious findings. They're not looking. Or they're being told not to look."

"Kowalski said he talked to the county sheriff," Carter said. "Told him the drownings were hurting tourism, asked for them to be handled quietly. I thought he meant just—media management. But if he's pressuring the ME's office..."

Marcus's jaw was tight. "How much money does Kowalski have? Enough to bribe a county official?"

"Doesn't have to be bribery," Jillian said. "Just—influence. The sheriff wants to keep beach towns happy, keep tourism flowing, keep county tax revenue up. Three mysterious drownings become a federal investigation, media circus, tourism dies for the whole region. Easier to call them accidents and move on."

"While people keep dying," Lisa said quietly.

"While people keep dying," Jillian confirmed.

Marcus gathered the photos. "This is the evidence we needed. Medical testimony, photographic documentation, expert analysis. We take this to the state police, bypass the county sheriff entirely."

"Will they listen?" Carter asked.

"They'll have to. This isn't speculation anymore. This is proof of homicide and official malfeasance."

Bobby was still staring at the photos. "You said the attacker has large, strong hands. That's not much of a profile. Half the men in Emerald Bay fit that description. Fishermen, dock workers, construction guys. Anyone who works with their hands."

"But not everyone has diving capability," Jillian countered. "The attacker approaches from underwater, stays submerged long enough to ambush and drown a victim, then escapes without being seen. That requires significant diving skill and equipment."

"Scuba gear?" Lisa asked.

"Possibly. Or just exceptional breath control and swimming ability. But either way, it narrows the suspect pool to people with underwater expertise."

Marcus pulled out his notebook—the one where he'd been logging beach activity. "I've been thinking about timing. The three drownings happened over eleven days. That's fast. Serial killers usually have cooling-off periods between kills. But this is escalation. Something triggered it."

"June," Bobby said. "Tourist season just started. Maybe the killer targets the start of summer specifically. More tourists, more targets, more opportunity."

"Or something else changed," Jillian said. "Environmental trigger, personal trigger, something that made the killer more active."

They debated for another hour—suspect profiles, victim selection, attack methodology. By the time they broke up, they had a clearer picture of their killer:

Male, almost certainly. Strong, capable swimmer, knowledge of local waters, diving capability, large hands. Age range thirty to sixty—old enough to have the strength and skill, young enough to be physically capable of overpowering adult swimmers underwater. Local or long-term resident—intimate knowledge of beach geography, victim patterns, how to avoid detection. Psychologically: mission-oriented, believes in environmental protection or purification, possibly religiously or ideologically motivated. Triggered to escalate recently, reason unknown.

It was a profile. Not specific enough to identify anyone, but enough to guide their investigation.

"Tomorrow," Marcus said, "I'm calling the state police. They need to know about this."

"What if they don't believe us?" Lisa asked.

"Then we keep investigating on our own. But we have to try official channels first." Marcus looked at each of them. "We're dealing with someone who's killed at least three people, possibly dozens. Someone who's comfortable drowning conscious victims. Someone who won't stop. We're out of our depth here—no pun intended. We need real law enforcement."

They agreed, though Bobby looked skeptical and Lisa looked frightened.

As they filed out of the shed, Jillian stayed back with Marcus.

"There's one more thing," she said. "Something Tim mentioned. He said the preliminary autopsy report had no suspicious findings. But it was marked 'pending final examination.' Which means there should be a full autopsy scheduled."

"When?"

"He didn't know. But here's the thing—if the full autopsy happens, if a competent ME actually looks at those bruises, they'll have to rule it homicide. It's too obvious to miss. Which means..."

"Which means someone might try to prevent the full autopsy," Marcus finished. "Rush the preliminary ruling, release the body to the family, cremate or bury the evidence before anyone looks too closely."

"Exactly."

Marcus was quiet, thinking. "We need those autopsy reports. All three victims. Official documentation that proves what we're saying."

"I'll ask Tim if he can access them. But that's risking his job, maybe criminal charges for breaching confidentiality."

"I know. Don't push him. But if he's willing..." Marcus trailed off. "This is getting complicated."

"It was always complicated. We're just seeing it clearly now."

They walked back to the resort together, the late afternoon sun painting the gulf in shades of gold. Beautiful. Peaceful. Deadly.

Somewhere in that water, or near it, was a killer. Someone who looked at swimmers and saw targets. Someone who grabbed ankles and pulled down until the struggling stopped.

And Jillian had the evidence to prove it.

Now they just needed someone to listen.
