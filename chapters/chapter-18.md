# Chapter 18: The Journals

The Polaroids were spread across the maintenance shed's workbench like evidence in a war room. Marcus stood with his arms crossed, staring at Cyrus Wade's neat handwriting. Forty-some murders documented across two decades. Systematic. Evil disguised as holy work.

The overhead bulb swayed, casting shadows. Outside, the gulf whispered. Past ten PM. Three hours of analysis.

"Read the first one again," Marcus said. His voice was flat, controlled. Cold analysis kept him focused. If he let himself feel what these entries represented, he'd lose control.

Jillian picked up the Polaroid of the oldest journal's first entry. She'd labeled it with a marker: "April 15, 1958 - First Entry." She read aloud:

"She spoke to me last night. From the waters. Caroline's voice, clear as bells. She weeps for the disrespect shown to her resting place. She has given me purpose. I will serve her. I will keep the sacred gulf pure."

"1958," Carter said from where he sat on an overturned bucket. "The year after Caroline drowned. He started hearing her voice immediately."

"Or he needed to believe he was hearing her voice," Jillian corrected. "The timeline fits perfectly. Wife dies in 1957 under mysterious circumstances—we should look into that more, by the way. Within a year, he's developed an auditory hallucination that gives him permission to kill. Classic grief-driven delusion."

Bobby paced near the door, unable to stand still. "Nobody noticed. Twenty-one years."

"They noticed," Marcus said. His voice was hard. "They just didn't care. Tourist drownings are bad for business. Accidents are easier." The sheriff's office had blood on its hands. Twenty-one years of looking away.

Lisa sat in the corner, hugging her knees, staring at her grandmother's entry. Quiet since they'd left the houseboat. They needed a plan.

"What about the methodology?" Marcus asked. "Can we establish a pattern?"

Jillian began laying out Polaroids in chronological order, as best she could tell from the visible dates. "The entries are incredibly methodical. Let me read you a typical one. This is from June 1962:"

She cleared her throat and read: "Thomas Brennan. New York tourist, age 33. Observed littering on beach, throwing cigarette butts in the water. Three days of surveillance confirmed disrespectful behavior. Approached at dusk offering free diving lesson. Led to deep water near pier. Used weighted rope as anchor point. Grabbed ankles at depth, held until struggle ceased. Body floated to surface within hour. Caroline is pleased. The gulf is pure."

The shed was silent except for the creak of the metal roof expanding and contracting in the night air.

"Jesus Christ," Carter breathed.

"It's the same every time," Jillian continued. "Watch the victim, identify what he considers a 'sin'—littering, urinating in the water, being loud and drunk, mocking the gulf's beauty. Then he plans the approach. Usually offers free equipment or advice, establishes himself as helpful. Gets them in the water. Uses his superior diving skills to attack from below. Grabs the ankles—we know about the bruising. Holds them underwater until they drown. Makes it look accidental."

Marcus's jaw ached from clenching. "And the sins are always environmental. Always about disrespecting the water."

"Right. He's not killing randomly. He's selecting victims based on perceived blasphemy against the gulf—or against Caroline's resting place, which is the same thing to him."

Bobby stopped pacing. "So he's not insane. He's got rules. A system."

"Oh, he's definitely delusional," Jillian said. "But you're right—he's organized. This is textbook mission-oriented serial killing with a religious delusion framework. He genuinely believes he's serving a higher purpose. Every kill reinforces that belief. 'Caroline is pleased.' He's getting positive feedback from his hallucination."

"Can we use that?" Marcus asked. "If we know his pattern, his victim selection criteria, can we bait him?"

Carter sat up straighter. "You want to set a trap."

"I want to catch him trying to kill someone, with witnesses, with proof that can't be dismissed." Marcus picked up another Polaroid, this one showing multiple journal entries. "These photos might not be admissible in court. We obtained them illegally. Cyrus could claim they're fabricated. But if we catch him in the act..."

"We'd have him," Carter finished. "No question. No way to explain it away."

"Dangerous, though," Jillian said. "We'd be using someone as bait. Someone who fits his victim profile—disrespectful tourist. And Cyrus has killed forty-seven people using these tactics. He's good at it."

Marcus met her eyes. "I know. But what's our alternative? Take these photos to the sheriff who's been covering up drownings for two decades? Hope he suddenly develops a conscience?"

"Marcus has a point," Carter said. "The sheriff's department has been complicit through inaction. They ruled every single drowning an accident. Even when there was evidence of manual bruising, even when circumstances were suspicious. They didn't want a murder investigation."

"Because murder investigations scare tourists," Bobby added bitterly. "Tourists are all Emerald Bay has. So they looked away."

Lisa spoke up for the first time in an hour. "We can't go to the cops. They won't help. We have to do this ourselves."

Marcus studied her. She'd been crying earlier, but now her face was hard, determined.

"If we do this," Marcus said, "we need a solid plan. Cyrus is dangerous—former Navy diver, strong, knows the water. Can't underestimate him."

"What if he doesn't take the bait?" Carter asked.

"Then we go to police with what we have. But I don't think we're wrong." Marcus held up the ritual photo. "He's hunting. Told Caroline he'd identified his next victim. Give him an obvious target, he'll bite."

Jillian nodded. "Makes sense psychologically. His delusion's been reinforced for decades. He believes he's protected. Overconfident."

"So who's the bait?" Bobby asked.

Everyone looked at Carter.

"What?" Carter said. "Why me?"

"You're perfect," Marcus said. "Rich tourist. Already been to the dive shop, so Cyrus knows your face but doesn't know you're with us. You can play obnoxious drunk convincingly—"

"Thanks," Carter muttered.

"—and you fit the profile. If you act disrespectful enough, throw trash in the water, make a scene, Cyrus will notice."

Carter was quiet for a moment, processing. Then he straightened his shoulders. "Okay. I'll do it."

"You sure?" Jillian asked. "This isn't a game. Cyrus has killed forty-seven people."

"I'm sure." Carter's voice was firm. "If it means stopping him, yeah, I'll be the bait. But I want backup. Good backup."

"You'll have it," Marcus promised. "Bobby and I will be in the water with snorkel gear. We'll be close the entire time, hidden near the weighted ropes we found. The second Cyrus makes his move, we move. He won't even get close to actually hurting you."

"Jillian and I will be on shore," Lisa said. "With the camera. We document everything."

Jillian nodded. "Visual evidence that Cyrus stalked and attacked Carter. Combined with the journals, it's an airtight case."

Marcus began sketching a rough map on a piece of scrap paper. "Here's the beach section. These are the weighted rope locations. Cyrus's houseboat is here. His typical approach pattern based on the journals is..." He traced lines on the paper. "We position Carter here, in the kill zone. Bobby and I submerge here and here, within fifteen seconds' swim. Cyrus won't see us if we're low and using the seagrass for cover."

"What if he sees you anyway?" Carter asked.

"Then we surface and confront him. Worst case, he runs. But he won't have killed anyone."

"What if he's faster than you think? What if he gets to me before you can react?"

Marcus looked at him directly. "Then Bobby and I pull him off you. We're two against one, and we'll be ready. He's strong, but we're younger. And we'll have surprise on our side."

Bobby cracked his knuckles nervously. "I can handle Cyrus underwater. I've been diving these waters my whole life. I know his tricks."

Carter took a deep breath. "Okay. When do we do this?"

"Tomorrow," Marcus said. "Late afternoon, near sunset. That's when most of his kills happened, according to the journals. Low light, fewer witnesses on the beach, perfect hunting conditions for him."

"Tomorrow," Carter repeated, and Marcus could hear the nerves underneath the bravado.

"We'll run through it in the morning," Marcus said. "Practice positions, timing, signals. By the time we execute, everyone will know exactly what to do."

Jillian was organizing the Polaroids into stacks. "We should hide these somewhere safe. Not the houseboat, not our rooms. Somewhere Cyrus can't find them if he somehow figures out we broke in."

"Bury them," Bobby suggested. "Wrap them in plastic, bury them on the beach. Mark the spot. If anything happens to us, at least the evidence exists."

It was a grim thought, but practical. They were going up against a serial killer who'd operated successfully for over two decades. There was real danger here.

"Agreed," Marcus said. "Carter, you and Jillian bury them tonight. Pick a spot you'll remember. Bobby, Lisa, and I will start planning the logistics for tomorrow."

They worked for another hour, hammering out details. What time Carter would start his performance. What he'd say and do to attract Cyrus's attention. Where Marcus and Bobby would position themselves underwater. What signals they'd use. What equipment they'd need—knives, just in case. A flare gun for emergency signals to shore. Waterproof watches to synchronize timing.

By midnight, they had a plan.

"Everyone clear on their roles?" Marcus asked.

Nods around the shed.

"Then get some sleep. Tomorrow we end this."

They filed out into the humid night. Carter and Jillian headed toward the beach, carrying the Polaroids wrapped in trash bags. Bobby walked toward his truck, shoulders hunched. Lisa lingered.

"Marcus," she said quietly. "Thank you. For taking this seriously. For doing something when nobody else would."

"Your grandmother deserved justice," Marcus said. "They all did."

"I know. But you're risking yourselves tomorrow. If something goes wrong..."

"It won't. We'll be careful."

Lisa nodded, then walked toward her room. Marcus stood alone outside the shed, looking toward the dark gulf. Somewhere out there, Cyrus Wade was probably asleep in his houseboat, dreaming of Caroline. Believing he was righteous. Believing the next day might bring another opportunity to "purify" the sacred waters.

Not this time, Marcus thought. This time, you're going to get caught.

He headed to his own room, knowing sleep would be difficult. Tomorrow they'd put everything on the line. Tomorrow they'd catch a serial killer, or die trying.

The gulf whispered against the shore, patient and eternal, keeping its secrets for one more night.
