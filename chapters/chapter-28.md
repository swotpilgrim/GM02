# Chapter 28: Cyrus Drowns

The call came at 6:47 AM. Marcus was finishing packing, planning to leave by eight. His phone rang—the resort office number. He almost didn't answer.

"Marcus Chen? This is Agent Reeves, FBI. I need you to come to the county jail. Now."

"What happened?"

"Cyrus Wade is dead. I need you and the others here. Can you contact them?"

Marcus's blood went cold. "Dead? How?"

"Just...come. Please."

Twenty minutes later Marcus pulled into the jail parking lot. Jillian's car was already there—she'd delayed her departure. Bobby's truck arrived moments after. They gathered at the entrance, confused, worried.

Reeves met them inside, looking like he hadn't slept. His face was pale, drawn. "Thank you for coming. I wanted you to see this before..." He trailed off. "Before the official story gets set. You deserve to know the truth."

"What truth?" Jillian demanded. "How did Cyrus die?"

"Follow me."

They went through security, deep into the jail. The holding area where suspects awaited trial was segregated from the general population—individual cells, monitored constantly. They reached Cell 7.

Crime scene tape across the door. Photographers documenting the interior. A medical examiner kneeling over something on the floor.

Cyrus Wade's body.

Marcus felt his stomach drop. The body was face-down in water on the concrete floor. Not much water—looked like barely an inch. But Cyrus's face was submerged in it, and he was clearly dead.

"How?" Bobby whispered.

"That's the question," Reeves said grimly. "Let me walk you through it. Cell was locked from the outside—single occupant, high-security because of the high-profile nature of the case. No one in or out since dinner was delivered at 6 PM yesterday. Guard checked on him at midnight—Wade was reading on his bunk, appeared fine."

"Next check was scheduled for 4 AM. Guard found him like this. Face-down, water on the floor, dead." Reeves paused. "Preliminary determination is drowning."

"In an inch of water?" Marcus couldn't process it. "That's not possible."

"It gets worse. Come look at the surveillance footage."

They moved to the security office. Reeves pulled up the video from Cell 7. Timestamp 2:47 AM showed Cyrus on his bunk, lying down, eyes closed. Sleeping.

"Watch," Reeves said.

At 2:51 AM, Cyrus's eyes opened. He sat up abruptly, staring at the corner of his cell. His mouth moved like he was talking to someone, but there was no audio.

At 3:02 AM, he stood and walked to the corner. Still talking. Gesturing with his hands. Having a conversation with nothing.

At 3:17 AM—the exact time the water appeared in his houseboat—the sink in his cell suddenly began overflowing. Water poured out impossible fast, way more than the pressure should allow. The plumbing team says normal water pressure couldn't produce that volume.

Cyrus turned toward the water. His expression changed—fear, then recognition, then something that looked like acceptance. He walked into the pooling water. Laid down in it. Face-down.

"Jesus Christ," Bobby breathed.

On the screen, Cyrus's body convulsed. He was struggling but not like someone trying to get up. Like someone being held down. His hands clawed at the floor, his legs kicked, but his face stayed submerged in the inch of water.

For two minutes he struggled. Then, at 3:22 AM, he went still.

The water continued pooling for another minute, then stopped. By dawn—visible in fast-forward—it had evaporated or absorbed, leaving just a damp patch and Cyrus's corpse.

"Rewind to when he was struggling," Jillian said, voice shaking. "Slow motion."

Reeves did. Frame by frame, they watched Cyrus fight against...nothing. There was no one else in the cell. No visible force holding him down. But his body moved like someone was pinning him, hands pressing his head into the shallow water.

"Medical examiner?" Marcus asked.

"Cause of death: drowning. Found seawater in his lungs."

"Seawater?" Jillian's voice cracked. "The jail uses freshwater. All plumbing is connected to the city water supply. It's impossible for seawater to come out of that sink."

"I know."

"So how—"

"I don't know." Reeves looked at each of them. "The official report will say Cyrus Wade died of drowning under suspicious circumstances. Manner of death: undetermined. Because we can't explain this. Not with any natural explanation."

"What really happened?" Bobby asked quietly. "What do you think happened?"

Reeves was silent for a long moment. "Off the record? I think whatever Cyrus believed was speaking to him from the gulf...I think it was real. And I think it killed him when he failed. When he got caught and couldn't kill anymore. Either punishment or..." He struggled for words. "Or it didn't need him anymore."

"That's insane," Jillian said. But her voice lacked conviction.

"I know. But watch the video again. Watch his face right before he goes into the water. He sees something. Recognizes it. And he's afraid."

They watched again. Cyrus's expression was clear—he saw something in that cell, something that terrified him. Then resignation. Acceptance. Like he knew what was coming and couldn't fight it.

"Caroline," Marcus said. "He thought it was Caroline."

"Or something using Caroline's image," Reeves said. "The dolls in his shrine dated back to the 1930s, decades before she died. The La Llorona legends go back centuries. What if there really is something in the gulf? Something old. Something that took Caroline when she drowned, used her image to manipulate Cyrus. Fed on his grief and delusion for twenty years. And when he failed..."

"It drowned him," Bobby finished. "In seawater. In a locked cell. In an inch of water. Just like he drowned his victims."

They stood in silence, processing the impossibility they'd just witnessed.

"The official story?" Marcus asked.

"Suspicious death under investigation. We'll never close the case because we'll never have an explanation that makes sense. But it'll be classified as a death in custody, cause undetermined."

"And the truth?"

"The truth is something I can't put in a report without destroying my career. The truth is a man confessed to forty-seven murders because he believed his dead wife told him to commit them. And then he died in an impossible way that suggests maybe—just maybe—he wasn't completely delusional."

Jillian was shaking her head, tears on her face. "This can't be real. The supernatural doesn't exist. It can't."

"Then explain the video," Reeves said gently. "Explain the seawater in a freshwater system. Explain a man drowning in an inch of water while something invisible holds him down."

She couldn't. None of them could.

"Are we in danger?" Bobby asked. "If this thing killed Cyrus, what about us? We stopped him. Are we next?"

"You've been back to the gulf since his arrest. Multiple times. Nothing's happened to you. I don't think you're targets. You didn't disrespect the water—you saved lives by stopping Cyrus. If there's an intelligence behind this, it got what it wanted. Cyrus failed. He was eliminated. You helped end the killings. There's no reason for it to target you."

"You're talking about it like it's a person," Jillian said. "Like it has motivations, makes decisions."

"I don't know what it is. But the pattern suggests intent. Cyrus hears voices, commits murders for twenty years, gets caught, dies impossibly in a way that mirrors his victims' deaths. That's not random. That's...purposeful."

They left the jail in a daze. Outside, morning sun was bright and hot. Normal. The world continued like nothing had happened. People drove to work, went about their lives, unaware that something impossible had occurred in a cell forty feet underground.

"I'm leaving today," Jillian said. "Right now. I can't stay here anymore."

"Same," Bobby agreed.

"Marcus?" Reeves asked. "You okay?"

Marcus wasn't sure. He'd watched a man drown on video—drown impossibly, held down by nothing, in water that shouldn't exist. His entire understanding of reality was fractured.

"Do you believe in it?" Marcus asked. "The supernatural explanation?"

Reeves was quiet. "I believe something happened in that cell that I can't explain. I believe the water in Cyrus's houseboat shouldn't exist but does. I believe multiple witnesses have heard crying over the gulf for decades. I believe there are things in this world we don't understand." He paused. "Do I believe a supernatural entity drowned Cyrus Wade in his cell? I think...I think it's the only explanation that fits. And that terrifies me."

They parted ways. Marcus drove back to the Sandpiper alone. He went straight to his room, grabbed his packed bags, threw them in his car. He needed to leave. Needed to get away from Emerald Bay, from the gulf, from everything that had happened.

But before he left, he drove to the beach one last time.

The water was calm. Beautiful. Azure blue under perfect sky. A few tourists were returning, children playing in the surf, families rebuilding sandcastles. Life going on.

Marcus stood at the waterline, waves lapping at his feet. He thought about Cyrus Wade, drowning in his cell. About Caroline Wade, drowning in 1957. About forty-seven victims over two decades. About water appearing impossibly every night in a shrine. About crying sounds carried on the wind.

"If you're real," he said quietly to the gulf, "if you're listening...we stopped him. We saved people. That should count for something."

The water gave no answer. Just continued its eternal whisper, patient and unknowable.

Marcus turned and walked back to his car. In his rearview mirror, the gulf stretched out behind him, beautiful and deadly. Keeping its secrets even now.

Some mysteries stayed mysterious.

And some truths were too terrible to accept.

He drove away from Emerald Bay, never looking back. But he'd never forget. Never be able to unhear the crying on the wind. Never be able to unsee Cyrus struggling against nothing in an inch of impossible water.

The gulf remembered.

And so would he.
