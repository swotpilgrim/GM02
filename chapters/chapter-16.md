# Chapter 16: The Stakeout

The fishing boat rocked gently in the dark water, its motor silent for the past two hours. Marcus sat in the stern, binoculars pressed to his eyes, watching Cyrus Wade's houseboat across the marina. The night air was thick with humidity and salt, the kind that made clothes stick to skin and lungs feel heavy. Beside him, Carter shifted position for the dozenth time, trying to get comfortable on the narrow bench.

"How much longer?" Carter whispered.

"As long as it takes." Marcus didn't lower the binoculars. The houseboat sat dark and still, moored at the far end of the marina where the working boats clustered. A single dim bulb burned over the slip number, casting just enough light to see the hull.

Bobby sat cross-legged on the deck, checking his watch every few minutes. "Past midnight. If he's going to do anything, it'll be soon. He always—" He stopped himself. "My grandmother said he'd go to the beach after midnight sometimes. Thought he was just a grief-stricken widower. Now..."

Lisa huddled next to Jillian in the bow, wrapped in a windbreaker despite the heat. She hadn't said much since they'd rented the boat at sunset, motoring into the marina under the guise of night fishing. They'd anchored in the shadows between two larger vessels, close enough to observe but far enough to avoid suspicion.

Jillian had a notebook open on her lap, pen ready, though she couldn't see well enough to write in the darkness. "If he performs some kind of ritual, we need to document everything. Exact words, actions, duration. It'll help establish his psychological state for—"

"There." Marcus straightened. "Lights just came on."

Everyone froze. Across the water, warm yellow light spilled from the houseboat's cabin windows. A shadow moved inside—tall, deliberate. Marcus adjusted the focus on the binoculars, his heart rate picking up. This was it. This was real.

"What's he doing?" Carter leaned forward, nearly tipping the boat.

"Hold still," Bobby hissed. "You'll rock us."

The houseboat's door opened. Cyrus Wade stepped onto the narrow deck, and even from sixty yards away, Marcus could see he was carrying something. Something that looked wrong—pale and limp.

"What is that?" Lisa's voice was barely audible.

Marcus tried to sharpen the focus. The object in Cyrus's hands was small, maybe a foot long, with protruding limbs. A doll. But not a toy-store doll—this one looked ancient, waterlogged, its fabric dress hanging in rotted strips.

"Jesus," Marcus breathed.

Cyrus set the doll down carefully on the deck railing. Then he disappeared back inside, returning moments later with an armload of candles—the tall religious kind, red glass holders with saints printed on the sides. He began arranging them along the railing in a precise pattern, lighting each one with a wooden match. The flames guttered in the light breeze, then steadied.

In the orange candlelight, Cyrus's face looked skeletal, all hard angles and deep shadows. He was humming something—a hymn, maybe. The sound drifted across the water, tuneless and unsettling.

"Is he praying?" Carter whispered.

"Shh." Jillian was scribbling in her notebook now, squinting at the page.

Cyrus finished lighting the candles. He positioned himself in the center of the deck, facing the dark gulf waters beyond the marina. Then, with surprising grace for a man his age, he lowered himself to his knees.

Marcus's hands were sweating on the binoculars. The rubber eyepieces felt slick. He wanted to look away but couldn't.

Cyrus raised his hands, palms up, in a gesture of supplication. When he spoke, his voice carried across the water—not shouting, but projected, like an actor who knew how to fill a space.

"Mi amor," Cyrus said, and the tenderness in his voice made Marcus's skin crawl. "Caroline, mi vida, mi corazón."

"He's speaking Spanish," Lisa whispered. "My grandmother spoke Spanish. He's saying 'my love, my life, my heart.'"

Cyrus swayed slightly, still kneeling, still speaking. "I serve you still. Twenty-two years I have served. I keep the waters pure, as you commanded. The sinners come, they pollute your domain, they disrespect your sacred resting place."

Bobby made a small sound in his throat, quickly stifled. His face in the darkness looked sick.

"But I purify them," Cyrus continued, his voice gaining strength. "I send them to you, cleansed. I am your instrument. Your hands in this world. I do your holy work."

Marcus felt his jaw clenching. This wasn't grief. This was something else entirely—a complete delusion, reinforced by years of isolation and killing. Cyrus genuinely believed he was righteous.

Cyrus reached for the waterlogged doll, lifted it with both hands like a priest elevating the communion host. "I offer you these tokens. I offer you these souls. Accept them into your eternal waters."

He threw the doll into the marina. It hit with a small splash and sank immediately.

Then Cyrus began pulling small objects from his pockets—shells, coins, something that glinted metal in the candlelight. One by one, he threw them into the water, each accompanied by a mumbled prayer in Spanish. The ritual had a rhythm to it, practiced and precise. This wasn't the first time. This was a ceremony he'd performed countless times.

"How long has he been doing this?" Carter's voice shook.

"Twenty-two years," Marcus said flatly. "That's what he said. Since 1957."

Jillian was writing furiously, trying to capture every detail. "He's exhibiting textbook delusional disorder with religious themes. The systematic nature of the ritual suggests obsessive-compulsive elements. He's built an entire mythology around his wife's death."

"He didn't build it," Lisa said softly. "My great-grandmother said the stories about La Llorona were old. Older than Emerald Bay. He just... stepped into them. Made himself part of the legend."

Marcus lowered the binoculars for a moment, blinking to clear his vision. When he raised them again, Cyrus was rocking back and forth, arms wrapped around himself, speaking rapidly in a mix of languages Marcus couldn't follow. The candles flickered. The houseboat creaked. The sound of Cyrus's voice rose and fell like a wave.

"...purify the disrespectful... send them home to you... the waters must be clean... Caroline, Caroline, speak to me..."

Then Cyrus stopped. Abruptly, completely still. His head tilted to the side, like a dog hearing a distant whistle.

In the fishing boat, no one breathed.

Cyrus was listening. Listening to something they couldn't hear. His face, caught in profile by the candlelight, wore an expression of intense concentration. Then, slowly, he smiled.

"Yes," Cyrus said, nodding. "Yes, I understand."

Marcus's hands tightened on the binoculars. Who was he talking to? There was no one there. Just him and the candles and the dark water.

"I will find another," Cyrus said, his voice clear and calm now, conversational. "I know the one you mean. I've been watching. Disrespectful. Loud. Polluting your sacred space. Yes, mi amor. I will purify him. Tomorrow, perhaps. Or the next day. When the time is right. When you tell me."

He nodded again, as if receiving confirmation. "The gulf will be pure. I promise you."

Marcus felt ice in his stomach despite the humid heat. Cyrus was planning another murder. Right now. Selecting his next victim based on some imagined conversation with his dead wife.

Cyrus rose to his feet with the same fluid grace. He began extinguishing the candles one by one, pinching out the flames with wet fingers. When the last candle died, darkness rushed back in. Cyrus stood for a moment in silhouette against the marina lights, then turned and went back inside the houseboat.

The door closed. The lights went out. The houseboat sat dark and silent again, as if nothing had happened.

For a long moment, no one in the fishing boat moved. The only sound was water lapping against the hull and the distant cry of a night bird.

Finally, Carter spoke, his voice hoarse. "That was—"

"Insane," Bobby finished. "Completely insane."

"No." Jillian closed her notebook, her hands shaking slightly. "That's what's terrifying. He's not insane. Not legally. He's delusional, yes, but he's organized, methodical, functional. He thinks he's doing God's work. Or his wife's work. To him, it's the same thing."

Marcus started the boat's engine, keeping it low. They needed to get out of the marina before someone noticed them. As they motored slowly toward open water, he replayed Cyrus's words in his mind. *I will find another. Tomorrow, perhaps.*

"We need to get inside that houseboat," Marcus said. "See what else he's hiding. If he's documented his killings, kept records, we need proof."

"Breaking and entering," Carter pointed out. "That's illegal."

"So is serial murder," Bobby shot back. "And the cops aren't doing shit."

Lisa spoke up, her voice steady despite the tremor Marcus could hear underneath. "My grandmother didn't get justice. Forty-something other people didn't get justice. If we have to break a law to stop him, then that's what we do."

Marcus looked at each of them in the darkness. Carter, who'd gone pale during the ritual. Bobby, whose hometown hero had turned out to be a monster. Jillian, whose scientific mind was trying to catalog what they'd witnessed. Lisa, who had every right to want revenge but was thinking about the other victims.

"Tomorrow," Marcus said. "When he's at the dive shop. We search the houseboat. All of us. We find his evidence, document it, and then we end this."

Jillian nodded. "Agreed."

"I'm in," Carter said.

Bobby was quiet for a moment, then: "I can pick the lock. Houseboats all use the same kind. Piece of cake."

"Good." Marcus steered them out of the marina, toward the beach where they'd launched. Behind them, Cyrus Wade's houseboat sat dark and still, keeping its secrets. But not for much longer.

As they approached the shore, Lisa turned back for one last look. "Did you hear it?" she asked quietly.

"Hear what?" Jillian said.

"When he was listening. When he tilted his head. I heard... something. Like crying. Very faint."

Marcus exchanged glances with Jillian. "I didn't hear anything."

"Neither did I," Carter admitted.

Bobby shook his head.

"Maybe it was wind," Lisa said, but she didn't sound convinced. "Or a bird."

Marcus pulled the boat onto the sand, killing the engine. They climbed out in silence, each lost in their own thoughts. As they walked toward the resort, Marcus couldn't shake the image of Cyrus kneeling on that deck, having a conversation with no one. Or having a conversation with something they couldn't see.

The gulf stretched out behind them, dark and calm and patient. Somewhere in those waters, according to Cyrus Wade, Caroline waited. Spoke. Commanded.

Marcus didn't believe in ghosts. But he believed in Cyrus. And that was terrifying enough.
