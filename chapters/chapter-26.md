# Chapter 26: Town Reaction

Emerald Bay fractured. Marcus watched it happen over the course of a week, the small tourist town splitting down invisible fault lines as residents processed what had been hidden in their midst for twenty-one years.

The Sandpiper closed officially on Friday. Mr. Kowalski held a brief meeting in the empty lobby—Marcus, two other staff members who hadn't quit, and Jillian. He looked like he'd aged twenty years.

"I'm declaring bankruptcy," he said without preamble. "The resort is done. Bookings for next summer have been canceled. Nobody wants to vacation where a serial killer operated. I'm sorry. You'll get your final paychecks, but that's it."

He handed out envelopes and left. Marcus opened his—two weeks' pay plus a small severance. More than he'd expected.

"End of an era," Jillian said quietly. "This place has been here since the fifties."

"Can't survive being the Gulf Coast Serial Killer's hunting ground," Marcus said. "The name is poison now."

They walked out together. The beach was empty. It was prime summer, should have been packed with tourists. Instead, maybe ten people total. A family packing up early. A fisherman. The emptiness was eerie.

Bobby's truck pulled up. He'd come to say goodbye—his grandmother was moving to Georgia, and he was going with her. Help her settle, maybe find work up there. Anything to get away from Emerald Bay.

"Ran into Earl at the marina," Bobby said. "He's closing his bait shop. Says business is down 80%. Nobody wants to fish the 'murder gulf.'"

"What about Wade's Gulf Diving?" Jillian asked.

"Shuttered. Building's for sale but nobody's buying. Who wants to run a business in the serial killer's old shop?" Bobby shook his head. "The whole town's dying. Tourism was all we had."

"What are people saying?" Marcus asked. "About Cyrus?"

"Depends who you ask." Bobby leaned against his truck. "Some folks, like my grandma, they're horrified. Can't believe they didn't see it. Feel guilty for all the times they recommended Wade's shop to tourists, sent people to their deaths without knowing."

"That's not their fault," Jillian said.

"Try telling them that. But then there's others..." Bobby's voice got hard. "Others who are defending him. Saying he wasn't right in the head, shouldn't be judged. Saying the victims probably did disrespect the gulf—littering, being loud, you know. Like that somehow excuses it."

"Are you serious?" Marcus felt anger rising. "They're defending a serial killer?"

"Not defending exactly. More like...explaining. Making him sympathetic. 'Poor Cyrus, lost his wife, went crazy with grief, didn't know what he was doing.' That kind of thing."

"He knew exactly what he was doing," Jillian said coldly. "He planned each murder. Documented them. Evaded detection for two decades. That's not insanity, that's calculation."

"I know. You know. But some people in this town..." Bobby trailed off. "They knew Cyrus their whole lives. Friendly guy, helpful, ran a good business. They can't reconcile that with serial killer. So they're making excuses."

"What about the sheriff?"

"Morrison's been suspended pending investigation. FBI and state police are going through every drowning case from the past thirty years. Found at least fifteen more that match Cyrus's pattern but weren't in his journals. Might've been earlier victims he didn't document, or they're looking at whether there could be others involved."

"Others?" Marcus felt cold. "You think Cyrus had accomplices?"

"FBI doesn't. But they have to check. Standard procedure when you find this many murders over this long a time."

They stood in silence. A car drove past slowly—out-of-state plates, probably lost. Or maybe disaster tourists come to see where the Gulf Coast Killer operated. Marcus had heard that was happening. People driving through Emerald Bay to take photos, like it was some macabre attraction.

"I got into a fight," Bobby said suddenly. "At Donovan's Tavern two nights ago. This guy—Tommy Sellers, graduated high school with me—he was drunk, started running his mouth about how Cyrus was just protecting the town. How the tourists don't respect anything, trash the place every summer, take what they want and leave. Said maybe Cyrus had the right idea, just went too far."

"Jesus," Marcus breathed.

"I hit him. Broke his nose. Got thrown out of the bar. Sheriff's deputy—not Morrison, one of the new state guys—he took me aside, said he understood but I needed to cool it. Said tensions are high, people are saying stupid things, best to walk away."

Bobby rubbed his knuckles. "But I couldn't walk away. Tommy was talking about my grandmother's friend. About Marie, Lisa's grandmother. About forty-seven real people like they were acceptable losses in some war against disrespectful tourists."

"Is that a common sentiment?" Jillian asked. "That the victims somehow deserved it?"

"Not common. But not rare either. There's this...undercurrent. Like Cyrus tapped into something people felt but wouldn't say out loud. Resentment of tourists. The way they treat the town like their personal playground, then leave and forget about us."

"That doesn't justify murder."

"Of course not. But it explains why some people are having trouble condemning Cyrus completely. He was one of them. Local guy, business owner, known to everyone. And the victims were outsiders. Tourists. People who'd be gone in a week anyway."

Marcus felt sick. "That's tribalism. Us versus them. It's how genocides start."

"It's how a serial killer operated for twenty-one years in a small town and nobody noticed," Bobby said. "Because deep down, some people didn't want to notice. Didn't want to believe one of their own could do that. Easier to accept the drownings as accidents than face the truth."

A car pulled up—news van. Reporter got out with a cameraman. Marcus, Jillian, and Bobby immediately turned away, headed for Bobby's truck.

"One last thing," Bobby said as they climbed in. "Lisa called me yesterday. Said her mom's getting hate mail. People blaming her for 'turning on' Cyrus, saying she brought shame to the town by helping expose him. As if Marie didn't matter because she was killed so long ago."

"That's disgusting," Jillian said.

"That's grief and denial and cognitive dissonance all mixed together. This town built its identity on being a friendly Gulf Coast community. Safe, welcoming, family-oriented. Finding out a serial killer lived here for decades destroys that identity. Some people can't handle it. So they're lashing out, finding scapegoats, anything to avoid facing the truth."

They drove around Emerald Bay aimlessly. The town Marcus had spent three summers in looked different now. The cheerful pastel buildings seemed fake, like movie sets. The smiling faces on restaurant signs looked sinister. Every storefront, every dock, every stretch of beach—all of it was tainted by what had happened here.

They passed St. Michael's Catholic Church. A funeral was ending—Marcus recognized the family. Their eighteen-year-old son had drowned three weeks ago. One of Cyrus's last victims. Black-clad mourners filed out, grief-stricken, finally knowing the truth about how he died.

At least they had answers. Forty-seven families had answers now. That was something.

Bobby drove to the cemetery on the edge of town. Marie Thibodeaux's grave was easy to find—fresh flowers everywhere. Lisa had been here recently. So had others. The grave had become a memorial for all of Cyrus's victims, a place to acknowledge the dead.

They stood at the headstone. Marie Elena Thibodeaux, 1935-1959. Beloved daughter, devoted mother. The epitaph was simple, gave no hint of the violence of her death or the decades it took to find her killer.

"Lisa said she's going to be okay," Bobby said quietly. "Eventually. The closure helps, even if it hurts. Knowing it wasn't an accident. Knowing someone cared enough to find the truth."

"Is she still planning to move to Tallahassee?" Jillian asked.

"Yeah. Starting community college in the fall. Getting out of Emerald Bay. Can't stay here with all the memories."

"None of us can," Marcus said.

They stayed at the cemetery until the sun began to set, then drove back to the Sandpiper. The parking lot was completely empty now. The resort looked abandoned, desolate. Marcus would move out tomorrow, head to Tallahassee himself to finish his last year at University of Florida. Put this summer behind him.

"Stay in touch," Bobby said as they got out. "When the trial happens, we'll need to see each other. Be a united front."

"We will," Marcus promised.

Bobby drove off, taillights disappearing around the curve. Marcus and Jillian stood in the empty parking lot, listening to the gulf whisper in the darkness.

"Do you think it'll ever go back to normal?" Jillian asked. "The town?"

"No. This changed everything. Emerald Bay will always be the place where that serial killer operated. Some towns recover from tragedies. Others don't. This one won't."

"That's sad."

"It's reality. Forty-seven people died here over two decades. That's not something you recover from."

They walked to their rooms. Tomorrow they'd pack, leave, return to their normal lives. But Emerald Bay would stay frozen in this moment—the summer the Gulf Coast Killer was caught, the summer the town's innocence died.

Marcus lay in bed that night listening to the gulf. He'd be gone tomorrow, but the water would still be here. The beaches would still be here. And somewhere, maybe, whatever had spoken to Cyrus Wade would still be here too. Waiting. Patient. Eternal.

Some mysteries stayed mysteries.

And some places were haunted by more than just memories.
