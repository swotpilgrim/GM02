# Chapter 30: Departure

End of August. The Sandpiper Resort was officially closed. A handwritten sign on the office door read "SEASONAL CLOSURE - SEE YOU NEXT SUMMER," but everyone knew there wouldn't be a next summer. Not here. Not after everything.

Marcus carried the last box to his Datsun, parked in the nearly empty lot. His entire summer—three months of life—fit into the trunk of a fifteen-year-old sedan. Clothes, books, a collection of photographs he'd never show anyone. Evidence of a summer that had changed everything.

The parking lot that had been full of tourists in June now held only four vehicles. Bobby's rusted pickup. Carter's Trans Am. Jillian's sensible Honda. And Lisa's borrowed station wagon, packed with everything she owned, ready for a new life in Tallahassee.

They'd made a pact two weeks ago: leave together. Final goodbyes on the beach at sunset. Close this chapter properly before moving forward with their lives.

Marcus checked his watch. 6:15 PM. Sunset in thirty-two minutes. Perfect timing.

The others emerged from the resort simultaneously, as if summoned by some unspoken signal. Jillian carried a paper bag—supplies for their farewell. Carter had his camera, determined to document this final moment. Bobby walked with hands in pockets, quiet, still processing. Lisa moved with more confidence than she'd had in June, trauma transformed into strength.

"Ready?" Marcus asked.

They nodded. No one spoke. They walked together down the familiar path to the beach, feet finding the worn trail automatically after three months.

The gulf stretched out before them, glass-calm and beautiful. Azure blue fading to turquoise near shore. The water looked innocent. Peaceful. Like nothing terrible had ever happened here.

Forty-seven people had drowned in these waters over twenty-one years.

And for eight weeks since Cyrus Wade's death, there hadn't been a single drowning.

"Still hard to believe it's real," Carter said, breaking the silence. "That any of this happened."

"The trial will make it real," Jillian said. "Six months, maybe less. We'll have to testify. Relive everything."

"I want to testify," Lisa said. "I want to tell my grandmother's story."

They reached their spot—the same stretch of beach where they'd caught Cyrus, where they'd spent countless evenings processing the investigation. The place that had become theirs through shared trauma.

Jillian opened the paper bag and pulled out five plastic cups and a bottle of cheap champagne. "Found this in the resort storage. Probably been there since the seventies. Seemed appropriate."

Bobby opened it carefully. The cork popped with a soft sound, and he poured five glasses.

They stood in a circle, cups raised.

"To Marie," Lisa said quietly.

"To Marie," they echoed.

"And to the forty-seven," Marcus added. "May they finally rest."

They drank. The champagne was terrible—flat, warm, probably spoiled. It didn't matter.

"So what happens now?" Carter asked. "Where does everyone go?"

"University of Florida," Marcus said. "Senior year. Finish my marine biology degree. Though after this summer..." He trailed off. What did marine biology mean after watching a man drown impossibly in an inch of seawater?

"Florida State," Jillian said. "Final year of biology. Then graduate school somewhere far from here. Maybe California. Maybe Maine. Somewhere without gulfs."

"Atlanta," Carter said, and he sounded reluctant. "Father's company. Management training. The life I was supposed to want." He paused. "But I'm taking weekends. Driving down to see you all. Staying connected."

"I'm heading to Tallahassee," Lisa said. "Thanks to you guys." She looked at each of them. "The money you all pitched in—for the apartment deposit, for tuition at the community college—I'll pay you back."

"No, you won't," Bobby said firmly. "It's a gift. You deserve a fresh start."

"Where are you going?" Lisa asked him.

Bobby shrugged. "Don't know yet. My family's in Georgia now. Maybe I'll join them. Maybe I'll find work somewhere else. Can't stay in Emerald Bay. Too many ghosts."

They fell silent, watching the water. The sun was sinking lower, painting the sky in oranges and purples. The same colors that had been there every sunset. The same eternal beauty.

"Have you seen the news?" Carter asked. "About the drownings?"

Marcus nodded. "Eight weeks. No incidents. Not a single one."

"So it stopped," Lisa said. "When Cyrus died, the drownings stopped."

"Or we just haven't seen the next one yet," Bobby said darkly.

"No," Jillian said. "The pattern is broken. Whatever was happening—whether it was just Cyrus or something using Cyrus—it ended when he died."

"You sound certain," Marcus said.

"I'm not," Jillian admitted. "But I have to believe it's over. Otherwise..." She gestured helplessly at the gulf. "Otherwise what do we do? Stay here forever watching? Warn people about something we can't prove exists?"

"We stopped it," Carter said. "However it happened, whatever the explanation, we stopped it. That has to be enough."

Marcus wanted to believe that. Wanted to accept that Cyrus's death had ended the killings, that the pattern was broken, that tourists could swim safely now. But doubt lingered. Agent Reeves's words echoed: "What if it finds someone else?"

"They're calling it the Gulf Shore Drownings now," Carter said. "The press. Making it sound like a disaster, not a serial killer. Forty-seven deaths over twenty-one years, all blamed on one man. The FBI confirmed every case. It's official."

"Does it feel official?" Lisa asked.

No one answered. Because it didn't. It felt unfinished. Ambiguous. Like they'd stopped Cyrus but not whatever had driven him. If anything had.

"We should exchange addresses," Jillian said, pulling out a notepad. "Phone numbers. Actual contact information. We're bonded for life now. We need to stay connected."

They spent the next twenty minutes writing carefully on torn paper. Marcus Chen, University of Florida, Dormitory 7, Room 314. Jillian Reeves, Florida State, off-campus apartment. Carter's Atlanta address, complete with business card ("Call anytime"). Bobby's temporary address at his grandmother's in Georgia. Lisa's new Tallahassee apartment.

"Visit me," Lisa said, folding her collection of addresses carefully. "Please. I don't want to lose touch."

"You won't," Jillian promised. "We'll visit. Write letters. Stay connected."

"Long distance relationships are hard," Carter said, looking at Marcus and Jillian. "Are you two actually trying this?"

Marcus glanced at Jillian. They'd been careful not to label what had developed between them. Romance born from trauma was complicated. But there was something real there.

"We're trying," Jillian said, meeting his eyes. "Different schools, three hours apart. But we're trying."

Marcus nodded. "We'll see each other on weekends. Write. Call. Figure it out."

"Good," Carter said. "You're good together."

The sun touched the horizon. Five minutes to full sunset. The gulf glowed orange and purple, reflecting the dying light.

"I'm going to miss this," Bobby said quietly. "Not Emerald Bay. Not the drownings. But... this. Us. The group. Working together toward something. Mattering."

"We'll always have this summer," Lisa said. "For better or worse, we're connected now. Forever."

They stood together, watching the sun sink. Five young people who'd arrived as strangers and would leave as something more. Not quite family, but bonded by shared trauma, shared triumph, shared questions they'd never answer.

"Time to go," Marcus said finally. The sun was nearly gone. Twilight approaching. The same twilight when Cyrus had hunted.

They turned from the water, walking slowly back toward the parking lot.

Then Lisa stopped.

"Do you hear that?"

They paused, listening.

Marcus heard wind. Just wind, rustling through the dune grass, carrying the salt smell of the gulf.

"Hear what?" Carter asked.

"Crying," Lisa said. Her voice was certain. "A woman crying. Out there." She pointed toward the water.

Bobby tilted his head, listening hard. "I... maybe? I'm not sure."

Jillian frowned. "I don't hear anything. Just wind."

"It's definitely crying," Lisa insisted. "Distant, but clear. Don't you hear it?"

Marcus listened harder. Wind in the grass. Waves lapping shore. And maybe—maybe—something that could be interpreted as crying if you wanted it to be. Or it could just be wind. Seabirds. Auditory pareidolia.

"I hear wind," he said carefully.

"Me too," Carter agreed.

Lisa looked at Bobby. "You hear it though. Right?"

"I hear... something," Bobby said. "Could be crying. Could be wind. I can't tell."

Lisa turned back to the water, staring at the darkening gulf. "She's still there. Waiting."

"Or it's wind," Marcus said gently.

Lisa was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Maybe."

They stood at the threshold between beach and parking lot, five people with five different perceptions. Did supernatural forces exist? Did something ancient dwell in the gulf? Or was it all just psychological projection, grief and trauma creating patterns where none existed?

They'd never know for certain.

"Come on," Jillian said softly. "It's time to go."

One by one, they walked to their cars. Hugs all around. Promises to write, to visit, to call. Lisa cried. Bobby's jaw was tight. Carter handed out more business cards, making everyone promise to contact him if they needed anything. Jillian and Marcus held each other longer than the rest, whispering private goodbyes.

Then engines started. Headlights came on. Four vehicles pulled out of the Sandpiper parking lot for the last time, driving away in different directions toward different futures.

Marcus watched them go in his rearview mirror. Then he drove away too, leaving Emerald Bay behind.

The gulf remained.

---

Empty beach. Calm water. The last light of sunset painting everything orange and purple.

Waves whispered against the shore, eternal and patient. The same sound they'd made for thousands of years. The same sound they'd make for thousands more.

Eight weeks since Cyrus Wade died in his cell. Eight weeks since the last drowning. The pattern was broken.

Or it was satisfied.

Or it was waiting.

No one could say which.

From somewhere across the water—or from the wind, or from nothing at all—came a sound that might have been crying. Distant. Faint. Ambiguous.

The gulf kept its secrets.

Some mysteries stayed mysteries.

And the patient waters waited, as they always had, as they always would.

Forever.
