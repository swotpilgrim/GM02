# Chapter 27: The Impossibility

Jillian knocked on Marcus's door at 2:47 AM. He opened it, groggy, confused. She stood there in sweatpants and a t-shirt, holding a notebook, looking shaken.

"Get dressed. We need to go to the forensics lab."

"What? Why?"

"Because I need to see it myself. The water. The impossible water. Agent Reeves gave me clearance to observe. It happens at 3 AM. We need to leave now."

Twenty minutes later they were driving inland, Jillian's hands tight on the steering wheel. She'd been quiet since they left, and Marcus didn't push. Whatever had changed her mind about wanting to see the supernatural anomaly, it had happened tonight.

They reached the county courthouse at 3:03 AM. The building was mostly dark except for the basement forensics lab. Agent Reeves met them at the door, looking tired.

"Dr. Martinez," he greeted Jillian formally. "Mr. Chen. The phenomenon should begin any minute. Follow me."

The lab was cold, air conditioning fighting humidity. Cyrus Wade's houseboat had been transported here intact, set up in a large evidence bay. Three technicians sat at a monitoring station, cameras pointed at the boat's interior through the open door.

"We've documented it for six consecutive nights," Reeves explained. "Always the same. Between 3:00 and 3:15 AM, seawater appears on the floor of the bedroom area, specifically where the shrine to Caroline Wade was located. Approximately one inch depth. It pools there for about ninety minutes, then begins evaporating or absorbing into the floor—we're not sure which. By dawn it's gone completely."

"And you've ruled out all natural explanations?" Jillian asked.

"Every one we can think of. No leaks, no hidden plumbing, no condensation explanation that fits the volume. The water is definitely seawater—Gulf salinity, tested multiple times. But there's no natural mechanism for it to be there."

A technician spoke up. "It's starting."

They crowded around the monitors. On the screen, the houseboat's bedroom floor—bare now, the shrine removed as evidence—showed nothing unusual. Then, slowly, dark spots began appearing on the weathered wood.

Marcus leaned closer. The spots were spreading, connecting, forming a shallow pool.

"Temperature readings?" Reeves asked.

"Dropping. Floor temp was 74 degrees. Now 68...66...62. Water temp is consistent with Gulf water—78 degrees. But the surrounding air is getting colder."

They watched in silence as the water pooled, spreading out in a rough circle about three feet in diameter. The amount was impossible—you couldn't get that much water from condensation or ambient humidity. It was just...appearing.

"Can we go in there?" Jillian asked. "Touch it?"

Reeves nodded. "We've tested it multiple times. It's just water. Non-toxic, normal seawater. Come on."

They entered the houseboat. The bedroom was small, cramped with the four of them. The water on the floor reflected the overhead lights, rippling slightly despite no apparent air movement. Marcus crouched down, dipped his fingers in.

Cold. Definitely seawater—he could taste the salt when he licked his fingertip.

"Where's it coming from?" Jillian was examining the floor boards, the walls, looking for any crack or seam.

"We've asked that for six days," a technician said from the doorway. "Can't find a source. It just...appears. Watch this."

She had a small camera on a tripod pointed at the floor. She played back footage at high speed. The water appeared gradually over about twelve minutes, spreading out from the center of where the shrine had been. No single point of origin—just gradual appearance across the entire area.

"That's not possible," Jillian said.

"And yet," Reeves replied.

They stayed for another hour, watching the water. It didn't grow deeper than an inch. Didn't spread beyond the three-foot circle. Just sat there, impossible and real.

"There was a report," Reeves said quietly, "from one of the technicians who was here alone two nights ago. Said she heard something. Around 3:15 AM, right when the water finished appearing."

"Heard what?" Marcus asked.

"Crying. A woman crying. Said it sounded like it was coming from the water itself."

Jillian was shaking her head. "No. No, that's suggestion. Power of suggestion combined with stress and working alone at night in a creepy environment. It's not real."

"Multiple technicians have reported it," Reeves said. "Not all of them. But enough that it's in the official reports."

They left the houseboat. In the observation area, Jillian paced, agitated.

"There has to be an explanation. Hidden reservoir. Capillary action. Some mechanism we haven't found yet."

"We've X-rayed the boat," Reeves said patiently. "Torn up floor boards. There's nothing there."

"Then we're not looking hard enough!"

"Or," Marcus said quietly, "we're looking for the wrong thing."

Jillian turned on him. "Don't. Don't go there."

"I'm not saying it's supernatural. I'm saying maybe the explanation isn't mechanical. Maybe it's...something else."

"Like what? Ghosts? Magic? The vengeful spirit of Caroline Wade manifesting seawater in her dead husband's shrine? That's not science, Marcus. That's fantasy."

"I know. But we've eliminated every natural explanation. At some point, when you've ruled out the possible..."

"Then you haven't looked hard enough at the possible." Jillian was adamant. "I refuse to abandon rational thought just because we can't immediately explain something. That's lazy thinking."

Reeves cleared his throat. "If it helps, the FBI's official position is that this is an unexplained phenomenon pending further investigation. We're documenting it, but we're not drawing conclusions."

"Bureaucratic cowardice," Jillian muttered.

They stayed until dawn. The water gradually disappeared, exactly as Reeves had described. By 5:30 AM the floor was dry. No residue, no staining. Just gone.

Driving back to Emerald Bay as the sun rose, Jillian was quiet. Marcus didn't push. Let her process.

Finally, as they pulled into the Sandpiper's parking lot, she spoke.

"I can't accept it. The supernatural explanation. Because if I accept that this one thing is supernatural, then I have to question everything else I know about how the world works. All of science, all of rational thought, everything I've built my understanding on—it all becomes questionable."

"I get that."

"But I also can't explain the water. And that terrifies me."

Marcus looked at her. "Maybe some things don't need explaining. Maybe some mysteries are meant to stay mysterious."

"That's a cop-out. That's giving up."

"Or it's accepting the limitations of human understanding."

They sat in the car, watching the sun rise over the gulf. The same water that had impossibly appeared on Cyrus Wade's houseboat floor. The same water that had claimed Caroline Wade in 1957 and forty-seven others in the years since.

"The dolls," Jillian said suddenly. "In the shrine. Some of them dated to the 1930s. Twenty years before Caroline died. Where did Cyrus get those?"

"He said he found them on the beach. Washed up."

"What if he didn't make up the La Llorona connection? What if there really is something in the gulf—something old, older than Caroline—and when she drowned, she became part of it? Or it used her? Cyrus's grief made him receptive, gave it a voice he could hear."

"That's a supernatural explanation."

"I know. And I hate it. But it fits the evidence better than anything else." Jillian rubbed her eyes. "The dolls predate Caroline. The La Llorona legends predate Cyrus. The crying sounds people have heard for decades. Cyrus didn't invent any of it—he just...tapped into something that was already there."

"Does it matter? Cyrus is in jail. The drownings stopped."

"But what if they start again? What if whatever was in the water, whatever influenced Cyrus, finds someone else? Someone else who's receptive, grieving, angry at tourists?"

"Then we deal with it. But we can't live in fear of hypotheticals."

"It's not hypothetical if the water keeps appearing every night."

Marcus had no answer for that. They sat watching the gulf turn from gray to blue in the morning light. Beautiful. Deadly. Unknowable.

"I'm leaving today," Jillian said. "Heading back to Tallahassee. I can't stay here anymore. This place...it's gotten under my skin. Made me question things I shouldn't question."

"Science is about questions."

"Not these kind. Not 'is the supernatural real' questions. Those are the kind that drive you crazy."

They got out of the car. Marcus helped her pack. By noon she was ready to go, her car loaded with bags and boxes.

"Stay in touch," she said. "When the trial happens, I'll see you then. Until then..."

"I know. Take care of yourself."

She drove away. Marcus was alone now. Carter gone, Bobby gone, Lisa gone, Jillian gone. Just him and the empty resort and the gulf.

He walked down to the beach one last time. The water was calm, glassy, reflecting the afternoon sun. Families were starting to come back—not many, but some. People willing to overlook the horror because the beaches were cheap now, desperate for tourism.

Marcus listened. Really listened. And maybe—just maybe—he heard it. Very faint. A woman crying. Or wind. Or waves. Or imagination.

He'd never know for sure.

And maybe that was okay.

He went back to his room, packed his own things. Tomorrow he'd leave Emerald Bay behind. Return to school, to normal life, to a world where serial killers were rare and supernatural mysteries didn't exist.

But he'd never forget this summer. The drownings. The investigation. Cyrus Wade's calm confession. The impossible water appearing every night in the shrine to his dead wife.

Some mysteries stayed mysterious.

And maybe they were supposed to.
