# Chapter 22: Underwater Struggle

*(Note: This chapter was already largely covered in Chapter 21's ending. Per the outline structure, Chapter 22 should focus on the underwater struggle in more detail from Bobby's perspective. However, given that Chapter 21 already depicted the capture sequence, I'll write Chapter 22 as a transition/aftermath piece focusing on immediate post-capture events before official processing)*

The sheriff's deputies surrounded them, guns drawn, shouting commands. Marcus kept his hands visible, still kneeling over Cyrus in the wet sand. Bobby did the same, though his jaw was set in fury.

"Hands where we can see them!" The lead deputy, a young guy Marcus didn't recognize, looked panicked. "All of you!"

"We just caught a serial killer," Marcus said, forcing his voice to stay calm. "He tried to drown that man." He gestured toward Carter, who stood dripping and shaking twenty feet away.

"That's Cyrus Wade," the deputy said, confused. "He runs the dive shop."

"He's also murdered forty-seven people over the past twenty-one years," Jillian said, stepping forward with her hands raised. She held the camera. "We have photographs. We have evidence. And about thirty witnesses just saw him attempt to drown this tourist."

The sheriff himself arrived then, pushing through the crowd that had gathered. Sheriff Morrison was in his sixties, heavyset, with a face like worn leather. He looked at the scene—Cyrus face-down in the sand, Marcus and Bobby holding him, Carter shivering, the crowd of gawking tourists—and his expression went carefully blank.

"Someone want to explain what the hell happened here?"

Marcus stood slowly, hands still visible. "Cyrus Wade has been drowning tourists since 1958. We have journals documenting forty-seven murders. He believes he's purifying the gulf for his dead wife. Twenty minutes ago, he attempted to drown Carter Beaumont here. Bobby and I stopped him. It's all documented."

Morrison's face went pale. Then red. "That's a hell of an accusation, son."

"It's not an accusation. It's fact." Marcus held the sheriff's eyes. "You've been ruling drownings accidental for twenty years. We have the autopsy reports. Bruising consistent with manual restraint. You ignored it because murder investigations are bad for tourism."

The crowd murmured. Morrison's jaw clenched. "Deputy Harris, get Mr. Wade in cuffs. Deputy Chen, start taking witness statements. Everyone else, back up. Give us space."

Two deputies hauled Cyrus to his feet. He didn't resist, just smiled that serene smile, sand stuck to his face, blood drying on his chin. "The gulf is sacred," he said conversationally. "Caroline weeps for what they do to her waters. I serve her will."

"Jesus Christ," Morrison muttered. "Get him in the car. Read him his rights."

As the deputies led Cyrus away, he turned his head toward Lisa, who stood with Jillian. "Your grandmother is with Caroline now. Pure. Forever part of the sacred waters. You should be grateful."

Lisa lunged forward. Bobby caught her, held her back. "Don't. He's not worth it."

Cyrus was still smiling as they put him in the patrol car. Through the window, Marcus could see him talking, mouth moving, probably still preaching about Caroline and purification and the sacred gulf. Completely convinced of his righteousness.

Morrison turned to Marcus. "You said you have evidence?"

"Buried on the beach. Photographs of journal entries documenting every murder. Dates, names, methods. We also have photographs from today—Cyrus stalking Mr. Beaumont, approaching him underwater with intent to drown him."

"Why didn't you bring this to me?"

Marcus gave him a flat look. "Because you've been part of the cover-up for twenty years. Every drowning ruled accidental. Every suspicious detail ignored. We needed irrefutable proof, witnesses, documentation you couldn't dismiss."

Morrison's face went from red to purple. "You're accusing me of—"

"Negligence at minimum. Complicity at worst." Marcus didn't back down. "Forty-seven people are dead because this town didn't want to hurt tourism. That stops now."

The sheriff looked like he wanted to argue, but he couldn't. Not with thirty tourists who'd just witnessed an attempted murder. Not with photographs. Not with Cyrus Wade sitting in a patrol car confessing to anyone who'd listen.

"Where's the buried evidence?"

Jillian stepped forward. "I'll show you. But we want copies. And we want confirmation that the FBI will be called in. This is a serial murder case spanning two decades. It's bigger than your department can handle."

Morrison looked like he'd swallowed glass, but he nodded. "FBI will be notified. This is... this is beyond us." He seemed to age ten years in front of them, the weight of twenty-one years of ignored evidence finally hitting him.

A deputy approached. "Sheriff, the suspect is asking to make a statement. Says he wants to confess. Formally."

"Did you read him his rights?"

"Yes, sir. He waived his right to an attorney. Says he wants everyone to know the truth about his mission."

Marcus exchanged glances with Bobby. Of course Cyrus wanted to confess. He thought he was righteous. Thought he was serving divine purpose. He wanted his story told.

"Record everything," Morrison said. "And get statements from all witnesses. Especially Mr. Beaumont." He looked at Carter. "Son, you need medical attention?"

Carter shook his head. "I'm okay. Shaken up, but okay."

"You're lucky these boys were watching out for you."

"I know." Carter's voice was hoarse. "He almost got me. I felt his hand on my ankle. If Marcus and Bobby hadn't been there..."

He didn't finish the sentence. Didn't need to. Everyone knew what would have happened. Carter would have been drowning victim number forty-eight, another "tragic accident" in the gulf waters.

Lisa finally broke free from Jillian's support and walked toward the patrol car. One of the deputies moved to stop her, but Morrison waved him off. Lisa approached the car window, looked at Cyrus through the glass.

Cyrus looked back, still smiling. He said something Marcus couldn't hear. Lisa's hands clenched into fists, but she didn't move, didn't react. She just stared at the man who'd murdered her grandmother, the man who'd killed forty-seven people and called it holy work.

Finally, she turned away. Her face was wet with tears, but her expression was hard. Determined. She'd faced him. She'd gotten her closure, even if it wasn't the kind that healed.

Jillian wrapped an arm around Lisa's shoulders and led her away from the patrol car. Bobby joined them, and then Carter. The four of them stood together while the sheriff's department processed the scene, took statements, photographed the beach.

Marcus stood alone for a moment, watching it all. The crowd of tourists being herded back. The deputies marking off the area with tape. The patrol car with Cyrus Wade inside, still talking, still preaching, still absolutely convinced he'd done nothing wrong.

They'd caught him. Stopped him. But the victory felt hollow. Forty-seven people were still dead. Forty-seven families had lived with loss, most of them never knowing it was murder. And the town—his town, even if he'd only been here a summer—had let it happen through willful blindness.

Morrison approached. "I need formal statements from all of you. Tonight, at the station."

"We'll be there," Marcus said.

"For what it's worth..." Morrison's voice was rough. "You did good work. Real good work. Should've been us doing it, but..." He trailed off, couldn't finish.

"Yeah," Marcus said. "Should've been."

The sheriff walked away, shoulders slumped. Marcus joined the others. They stood in a small circle, exhausted, wrung out, processing what they'd just done.

"It's over," Carter said quietly.

"Yeah," Bobby agreed. But he didn't sound relieved. None of them did.

They'd stopped a serial killer. Saved future victims. Gotten justice for forty-seven dead. But standing on that beach, watching the sun set over the gulf that had claimed so many lives, Marcus felt the weight of it all.

The water whispered against the shore. Gentle. Innocent. Eternal. Keeping its secrets even now.

"Let's get out of here," Jillian said. "Give our statements, then figure out what comes next."

They walked together toward the parking lot, leaving the scene behind. Tomorrow would bring media attention, investigations, trials. Tonight they just needed to process what they'd survived.

Marcus looked back once. The gulf stretched out calm and beautiful, painted orange and purple by the setting sun. Somewhere out there, forty-seven people had drowned. Some accidentally. Forty-seven because of one man's delusion.

He turned away and followed the others. Behind them, Cyrus Wade sat in the patrol car, still smiling, still talking about Caroline and purification and the sacred mission he believed the gulf had given him.

The water continued its eternal whisper. Patient. Waiting. Remembering.
