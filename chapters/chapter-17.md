# Chapter 17: The Shrine

Marcus pressed the walkie-talkie button. "He's still with customers. You're good."

Static crackled. Bobby's voice came through, tense. "Roger that. Starting now."

Marcus stood in the bait shop's shadow, watching Wade's Gulf Diving through his sunglasses. Cyrus was helping a couple select snorkel masks. Patient. Thorough. No idea his houseboat was being searched.

If they got caught, everything would be worthless. Illegally obtained evidence. But they needed to know what was inside.

Across the parking lot, Jillian sat in Carter's Trans Am, pretending to read. Carter lounged on the beach with a beer and newspaper. Bobby and Lisa did the actual break-in.

"Bobby? Status?"

"Almost got it. Yeah. We're in."

Marcus's heart rate kicked up. "Make it quick. Fifteen minutes, max."

---

Inside the houseboat, Bobby eased the door shut. The lock had taken ninety seconds. Lisa slipped in after him, eyes adjusting to the dimness.

The interior smelled like bleach and salt water, with an undertone of something organic. Not quite rot, but close. The living space was small—a galley kitchen to the left, a narrow sitting area with a built-in bench, a doorway to what must be the bedroom in the back. Everything was obsessively clean. The counters gleamed. The floor showed fresh vacuum lines in the thin carpet. Not a dish in the sink, not a book out of place. Even the air felt sterile, controlled.

"Jesus," Bobby whispered. "My grandma wasn't this neat, and she ironed dish towels."

Lisa moved carefully, hyper-aware of every footfall. They couldn't leave evidence they'd been here. She noticed the details—the coffee mug in the drying rack, positioned handle-out. The magazines on the side table, edges perfectly aligned. The couch cushions without a single wrinkle. This was the home of someone with military discipline, or someone whose mind demanded perfect order to hold back chaos. Maybe both.

Bobby was checking the kitchen cabinets, pulling them open carefully. Canned soup, crackers, instant coffee. Everything arranged with labels facing forward. Nothing unusual, but nothing human either. No personal touches, no mess, no life.

Lisa walked to the bedroom doorway and peered in. A narrow bunk, made with hospital corners. A small dresser. A porthole window that looked out at the marina. And on the wall—

"Bobby," she said softly. "Come here."

The bedroom wall was covered in photographs. Caroline. Dozens of pictures of Caroline Wade—wedding photos, beach snapshots, formal portraits. All carefully framed, arranged in a grid pattern that must have taken hours to align perfectly. In every photo, Caroline smiled. Dark curly hair, bright eyes, full of life. A beautiful woman frozen in time, worshipped from beyond the grave.

"His wife," Lisa said. "That's Caroline."

Bobby stared at the wall of photos. "He's built a shrine to her."

"No." Lisa's voice was quiet. "This is just the beginning."

She stepped into the bedroom, moving along the wall. The photographs covered every surface except for one section near the dresser. There, the wood paneling looked slightly different—the seams not quite matching the rest, like someone had cut and rehung a section.

"Bobby. Look at this."

He came closer, running his fingers along the edge. "False panel. Hidden storage." He pulled out his pocketknife, worked the tip into the seam, and pried gently. The panel popped loose with a soft click.

Behind it was darkness.

The smell hit them—salt water and decay and something sweet-rotten. Lisa covered her nose and mouth.

Bobby's flashlight clicked on, beam sweeping the hidden space.

For a long moment, neither of them could speak.

The space was maybe four feet wide and two feet deep, built into the hull itself. And it was filled with dolls. Dozens of dolls, arranged in neat rows on shelves that Cyrus must have built himself. But these weren't toys from a store. These were waterlogged, rotted, ancient things. Their fabric bodies were stained dark brown and black, their faces cracked porcelain or carved wood worn smooth by water. Some were missing limbs. Others had empty eye sockets where glass eyes had fallen out or been eaten by time. They looked like corpses, like drowned children preserved in this hidden tomb.

They were all facing forward. All facing Caroline's portrait, which hung on the back wall of the hidden space—the wedding photo, enlarged, in a cheap gilt frame. Watching her. Waiting for her.

"What the hell," Bobby breathed, and his voice shook.

Below the shelves, the space opened up. Newspaper clippings covered every inch of wall, layered and overlapping. Bobby moved the flashlight across them, and Lisa saw the headlines:

TOURIST DROWNS AT EMERALD BAY
OHIO MAN FOUND DEAD IN GULF WATERS
TRAGIC ACCIDENT CLAIMS SWIMMER'S LIFE
WOMAN'S BODY RECOVERED FROM SHALLOW WATERS

Each headline was circled in red ink. Dates going back years. Decades. A timeline of death.

And at the bottom of the space, stacked neatly on the floor, were leather-bound books. Six of them, identical, arranged by size.

"Journals," Lisa said, her voice barely a whisper. "Those are journals."

Bobby reached in, pulled out the top one, and opened it. The pages were covered in neat handwriting, blue ink, perfectly straight lines like someone had used a ruler. He read aloud, his voice shaking:

"June 3, 1979. Michael Patterson. Atlanta businessman, age 47. Witnessed throwing beer cans into sacred waters. Mocking the gulf's beauty. Loud complaints about cleanliness. Purified at sunset. Caroline is pleased."

He flipped forward. More entries. Page after page of entries. Names, dates, sins, methods.

"This is all of them," Bobby said. "Every person he killed. He documented every single one."

Lisa felt the floor tilt under her feet. She reached out, steadied herself on the doorframe. "We need to photograph these. All of them."

Bobby pulled out his walkie-talkie. "Marcus. We found something. It's bad."

"How bad?"

"Journals. Shrine. He's got everything documented. Years of killings. Maybe decades."

"Jesus. Okay. Get photos. Be quick."

Carter appeared in the bedroom doorway, Polaroid camera in hand. "Jillian's watching the road. Let's do this fast."

For the next ten minutes, they worked in near silence. Carter photographed the shrine from every angle—the dolls, the portrait, the newspaper clippings. He documented the journals, opening each one and taking photos of random pages, making sure to capture dates and names and Cyrus's neat documentation of sins committed.

Lisa pulled out the oldest journal, the leather cracked and stiff. She opened it to the first page:

"April 15, 1958. She spoke to me last night. From the waters. Caroline's voice, clear as bells. She weeps for the disrespect shown to her resting place. She has given me purpose. I will serve her. I will keep the sacred gulf pure."

"1958," Lisa said. "The year after she died. He's been killing for twenty-one years."

Carter was shaking out Polaroids, laying them on the bunk to develop. Bobby was flipping through another journal, counting entries. "I've got eight in this one alone. Eight people in... looks like 1963 through 1966."

Lisa picked up a different journal, opened it at random. Her eyes skimmed the entries—dates, names, sins. Littering. Public urination. Drunken behavior. Mocking the water. Each one ending with the same phrase: *Caroline is pleased.*

Then she saw it. A name she knew.

"Marie Thibodeaux," Lisa read aloud, her voice cracking. "June 12, 1959."

The room went silent. Carter lowered the camera. Bobby stopped flipping pages.

Lisa's hands were shaking so badly she could barely hold the journal. She read the entry, forcing the words out:

"Marie Thibodeaux. Local woman, age 24. Spoke ill of the sacred waters at the tavern. Called them 'dirty' and 'too warm.' Showed disrespect in front of tourists, spreading her blasphemy. Followed her to dawn swim. Purified in shallow waters. Caroline is pleased. The gulf is purer today."

The journal slipped from Lisa's fingers and hit the floor with a thud. She stood there, staring at nothing, her chest tight.

Her grandmother. Murdered for a drunken complaint about the water being murky.

Bobby moved toward her. "Lisa—"

"She was twenty-four," Lisa said, and her voice sounded far away. "My mother was six months old. My grandmother complained that the gulf water was warm, and he killed her for it."

Carter was photographing the page, the flash popping. Lisa wanted to tell him to stop, that this was her family, her history, not just evidence. But she couldn't make her mouth work.

"Lisa." Bobby touched her shoulder gently. "We're going to get him. This is proof. This is everything we need."

"She was twenty-four years old." Lisa's eyes burned. "Her whole life ahead of her. My mom grew up without a mother. My great-grandmother died thinking it was an accident. And it was because Marie said the water was dirty?"

Jillian's voice crackled over the walkie-talkie, making them all jump. "Guys. Customer just left the dive shop. Cyrus might close early."

"We need to go," Carter said, scooping up the Polaroids and shoving them into his backpack. "Now."

Bobby was already returning the journals to their stack, making sure they were in the exact order he'd found them. Carter replaced the panel, pressing until it clicked back into place. They moved through the houseboat quickly, checking that everything was as they'd found it. The lock clicked shut behind them as they stepped onto the dock.

Lisa walked mechanically, one foot in front of the other. Bobby had his hand on her elbow, guiding her. They crossed the marina, casual and unhurried, just locals out for an afternoon walk. But Lisa felt like she was moving through deep water, everything slow and muffled.

They reached the Trans Am. Jillian took one look at Lisa's face and pulled her into a hug. Lisa stood stiff for a moment, then broke, sobbing into Jillian's shoulder.

"We found her grandmother's entry," Bobby told Marcus quietly. "1959. Killed for calling the water dirty at a bar."

Marcus's jaw clenched. "How many total?"

"We counted entries in three of the journals," Carter said. "At least forty documented kills. Could be more."

"Forty people," Marcus said. "Over twenty years. And nobody noticed."

They stood in silence, Lisa crying quietly, the rest of them processing what they'd just seen. The shrine. The dolls. The meticulous records of murder disguised as holy work.

Finally, Lisa pulled away from Jillian, wiping her eyes. "We have to stop him. Not just for the recent victims. For all of them. For Marie."

"We will," Marcus promised. "We have the proof now. All of it."

Bobby looked toward the marina. "He's not going to stop. He thinks his dead wife wants him to keep killing."

"Then we make him stop," Jillian said coldly. "We catch him in the act. Force him to confess."

Carter held up his backpack, heavy with Polaroids. "We've got evidence. Now we need a plan."

They climbed into vehicles, engines starting. Behind them, Cyrus's houseboat sat in the afternoon sun, clean and neat, hiding forty-seven secrets.

Lisa leaned against the car window, watching the marina disappear. She kept seeing that journal entry. Her grandmother's name. *Purified in shallow waters.* Like Marie's life was worth nothing.

"I'm going to be there when we catch him," Lisa said quietly. "For her."

No one argued.
