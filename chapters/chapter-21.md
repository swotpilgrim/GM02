# Chapter 21: Baiting the Trap

The afternoon sun beat down on the beach, turning the sand into a griddle. Marcus lay in chest-deep water, his body still except for the gentle sway of the current. The snorkel tube extended above the surface, drawing air that tasted like salt and rubber. His mask pressed against his face, creating a sealed world of blue-green water and swaying seagrass.

He'd been in position for twenty minutes. His legs ached from staying motionless. Through the water, he could see Bobby thirty feet to his left, also submerged, also waiting. They'd synchronized watches before entering. 4:47 PM. Carter was due any minute.

Above the waterline, the beach was moderately populated. A few families with children building sandcastles. An elderly couple under an umbrella. A teenager with a surfboard. Normal July activity. None of them knew they were about to witness the capture of a serial killer.

The seagrass provided decent cover, but the water was clear. Too clear. If Cyrus looked carefully, he might spot them. But according to the journals, Cyrus focused on his victims, not his surroundings. Overconfidence built over twenty-one successful years.

Movement above. Marcus tilted his head slightly, keeping the snorkel steady. Through the rippling surface, he saw a figure approaching. Blonde hair, red swim trunks, carrying a cooler. Carter.

Carter dropped his gear—beach towel, cooler, portable radio—in the kill zone Marcus had marked on the map. The exact spot where the weighted ropes were closest, where Cyrus had the best approach vectors. Carter spread the towel with exaggerated motions, making himself visible. Noticeable.

The radio clicked on. Cheap transistor, tinny speakers. Fleetwood Mac drifted across the beach. Carter cracked open a beer—not his first if he was staying in character—and took a long drink.

"Hell of a beach," Carter announced to no one in particular. His voice carried. "Trashy as hell."

An elderly woman nearby looked over, disapproving. Carter didn't notice or didn't care. He sprawled on the towel, drinking, making himself at home in the way entitled tourists did. Marcus had to admit, Carter was good at this.

Through the water, Marcus checked Bobby's position. Still motionless. Still waiting. Somewhere up on the beach, Jillian and Lisa sat with the camera, pretending to be tourists enjoying the sunset. All pieces in position.

Now they needed Cyrus to take the bait.

Carter finished his beer, crushed the can with unnecessary force, and tossed it toward the water. It landed in the wet sand, aluminum glinting. A small child nearby stared at the littering. Her mother pulled her away, giving Carter a disgusted look.

Perfect.

Carter stood, swaying slightly. The drunk act was convincing. He waded toward the water, shorts riding low, sunglasses askew. "Water better be clean," he muttered, loud enough for nearby beachgoers to hear. "Whole beach smells like dead fish."

He splashed into the surf, making noise. Kicking water. Being obnoxious.

Marcus's heart rate picked up. This was it. The performance. If Cyrus was watching—and according to the journals, he was always watching—he'd see this. Rich, drunk, disrespectful tourist. Littering. Mocking the gulf. Exactly the type Cyrus believed Caroline wanted purified.

Carter waded deeper. Waist-deep now. He was twenty feet from Marcus's position, close enough that Marcus could surface and reach him in seconds if needed. Bobby was positioned on the other side, creating a net.

Minutes passed. Carter continued his performance, splashing around, drinking another beer he'd brought into the water. The sun inched lower. Golden hour approaching. Perfect lighting for photographs but also perfect for Cyrus's preferred kill time—dusk, fewer witnesses, fading light.

Through the water, Marcus scanned the approach vectors. The marina was visible in the distance, Cyrus's houseboat a dark shape against the docks. The dive shop, closed now, shutters down. No movement.

Had Cyrus not seen them? Was he not taking the bait?

Then Marcus saw it.

A figure emerging from behind the dive shop. Too far to identify clearly through the water's distortion, but the build was right. Lean, weathered, moving with purpose. The figure carried something—a dive bag.

Cyrus.

Marcus's pulse hammered. He forced himself to breathe slowly through the snorkel. Stay calm. Stay still. Let Cyrus commit.

The figure walked down the beach access path, fifty yards from Carter's position. He set down the bag near a public shower station, began removing his shirt. Putting on a wetsuit top. Casual, like any diver preparing for an evening dive.

But Marcus could see the pattern now. Cyrus wasn't approaching Carter directly. He was setting up at a distance, preparing his equipment where he couldn't be associated with Carter. Then he'd enter the water separately, approach from below, make it look like an accident when he drowned another disrespectful tourist.

Carter was oblivious, splashing around, finishing his second beer. He'd tossed the empty can back toward shore. More littering. More ammunition for Cyrus's twisted sense of righteousness.

Cyrus finished with the wetsuit, picked up fins and mask. He walked to the water's edge, away from Carter, away from the main beach crowd. Casual. Normal. Just another evening dive.

He waded in.

Marcus watched through the water as Cyrus's legs appeared, distorted by ripples. The older man moved with practiced efficiency—fins on, mask adjusted, snorkel in place. Then he submerged.

And disappeared into the blue-green depth.

Marcus strained to see. Visibility good, but Cyrus entered at an angle, out of sight. Using bottom undulations, seagrass for cover.

5:14 PM. Carter chest-deep, twenty-five feet from shore. Oblivious.

Movement. There—thirty feet out, swimming low. Gray wetsuit. Cyrus, approaching from south. Exactly as predicted.

Marcus signaled—pointing, three fingers. Bobby's head tilted. Seen.

Twenty feet. Fifteen. Cyrus swimming with just fins, arms tucked. Predatory. Patient.

Ten feet.

Carter splashed, unaware.

Cyrus directly below now, eight feet down. Weighted rope visible nearby.

Cyrus reached up. Hands extending toward ankles.

Marcus kicked hard. Bobby moved simultaneously. Two directions. Before Cyrus could react.

Five feet. Three. Marcus saw him clearly—gray beard, focused expression, pale blue eyes locked on Carter's legs.

Cyrus's fingers brushed Carter's ankle.

Marcus hit from behind, arms wrapping Cyrus's torso. Bobby grabbed shoulders. Cyrus's head snapped around, eyes wide. Shock.

Surprise was everything.

Cyrus thrashed, stronger than expected. Elbow drove back, caught Marcus's ribs. Pain flared. Marcus held on. Bobby had upper arms pinned, but Cyrus twisted, fighting.

Carter looked down, eyes wide. Kicked backward for shore.

Cyrus's mask knocked askew. Water flooded in. Distracted, Marcus got better hold—chest, dive belt.

Bobby pulled up. Marcus pushed. Together forced Cyrus to surface.

They broke explosively. Cyrus gasped, coughing, fighting immediately. Hands clawed. Legs kicked.

"Hold him!"

"Got his legs!" Marcus wrapped both arms around Cyrus's knees. Shocking strength—wiry muscle, decades of diving, desperation.

Cyrus's fist connected with Bobby's jaw. Bobby's head snapped but held on. "Swim for shore!"

Awkward swim. Marcus kicking with fins, arms controlling legs. Bobby propelling, restraining upper body. Thirty feet felt like miles.

Cyrus bucked. "Let me go! She needs this! Caroline—"

"Shut up."

Beach tourists standing, watching. Woman screamed. Children pulled back. Someone shouted about police.

Twenty feet. Fifteen. Cyrus tiring but dangerous. His dive knife—strapped to calf. Reaching for it.

"He's got a knife!"

Bobby twisted Cyrus's arm backward, away from blade. Cyrus cried out, kept fighting.

Ten feet. Five. Fins touched sand. Dragged Cyrus to shallows, water churning.

Together forced Cyrus stomach-down in ankle-deep water. Marcus pinning legs, Bobby controlling arms. Cyrus's face pressed wet sand, still speaking.

"Caroline told me... waters must be pure..."

Carter reached them, breathing hard, helping. Jillian and Lisa running across beach, Lisa with camera.

Crowd gathered. Tourists with wide eyes. Frozen teenager. Clutching elderly couple.

"Someone call the sheriff!"

A man ran toward the resort.

Lisa pushed through. Determination, grief, rage. She knelt so they were eye-level.

"Marie Thibodeaux. 1959. You murdered her for saying water was dirty. My grandmother."

Cyrus stopped struggling. Looked at Lisa, nodded.

"I remember Marie. She blasphemed. I sent her to Caroline. She's pure now."

Lisa's slap echoed sharp and loud. Cyrus's head rocked.

"She was twenty-four. Had a daughter. You took her from us. For nothing."

"Not insane. Divine. Caroline speaks. I serve her. I purify."

"You murdered forty-seven people."

"Forty-seven sinners. Forty-seven purifications. Caroline is pleased."

Bobby pressed Cyrus's face harder. "Shut up."

But Cyrus smiled, sand in teeth, blood on chin. "You can't stop her will. The gulf remembers. I am her instrument."

Sirens wailed. Sheriff finally responding.

They had him. Caught attempting murder. Witnesses. Photographs. Confession.

Lisa stood, backing away, crying. Jillian wrapped arms around her. Carter dripping, shaking. Bobby kept Cyrus pinned, jaw clenched.

Marcus looked down at Cyrus Wade—serial killer, zealot, monster. Small now. Pathetic. Old man face-down spouting nonsense.

But his eyes held absolute conviction. Terrifying certainty.

Sheriff's patrol car skidded to stop. Deputies ran, guns drawn, shouting.

Over.

They'd caught him.

Marcus met Bobby's eyes. Bobby nodded. Exhausted. Relieved. Victorious.

The gulf whispered behind them, gentle waves, as if nothing had happened at all.
