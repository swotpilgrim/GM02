# Chapter 19: Lisa's Closure

The maintenance shed was empty except for Lisa. The others had left an hour ago—Marcus to his room, Bobby to his truck to sleep (he said the resort beds made his back hurt), Jillian and Carter to bury the Polaroids on the beach. They'd asked if she wanted company. She'd said no.

Now she sat alone in the circle of light from the overhead bulb, holding the Polaroid of her grandmother's journal entry. The image was grainy, black and white, but the words were clear enough. She'd read them so many times in the past hour that she had them memorized.

*Marie Thibodeaux. Local woman, age 24. Spoke ill of the sacred waters at the tavern...*

Twenty-four. Lisa was twenty now. In four years, she'd be the age her grandmother was when she died. When she was murdered. The word still felt surreal. For twenty years, Lisa had believed her grandmother drowned accidentally. A tragic mishap. Bad luck. The family story was that Marie had gone for an early morning swim, got a cramp maybe, went under. It happened. The gulf could be dangerous.

Except it wasn't an accident. It was never an accident.

Lisa set the Polaroid down on the workbench, her hands shaking. She'd cried earlier, sobbing into Jillian's shoulder until she had no tears left. Now she just felt hollow. Numb. Like someone had scooped out her insides and left her empty.

Her great-grandmother had died five years ago, never knowing the truth. She'd spent forty years thinking her daughter drowned, blaming herself for not being there that morning, for letting Marie go to the beach alone. The guilt had eaten at her, made her bitter and sad. Lisa remembered visiting her as a kid, the old woman sitting in her rocking chair, staring out the window toward the invisible gulf, crying sometimes for no reason Lisa could understand.

Now she understood.

Marie had been murdered for complaining that the water was dirty. A drunken comment at a bar. Probably didn't even remember saying it the next day. And Cyrus Wade had heard it, deemed it blasphemy, and killed her for it.

Lisa picked up the Polaroid again. The entry was so matter-of-fact. Clinical. Like Marie was trash being thrown away, not a person. Not a mother. Not someone's daughter. Just another sinner to be purified.

*Followed her to dawn swim. Purified in shallow waters. Caroline is pleased.*

Purified. Like Marie was dirty. Like her life was worth nothing.

Lisa's hands clenched into fists, crumpling the Polaroid slightly. She forced herself to relax, smoothed out the photo. They needed this as evidence. She couldn't destroy it, no matter how much she wanted to.

The shed door creaked open. Lisa looked up, expecting Jillian or maybe Marcus checking on her. Instead, it was Bobby, holding two beers. He held one out without speaking.

Lisa took it. "Thought you were sleeping in your truck."

"Can't sleep." Bobby sat down on the overturned bucket Carter had been using earlier. "Keep thinking about..." He gestured vaguely at the workbench, the remaining Polaroids they hadn't buried yet. "All of it."

They sat in silence for a moment, drinking. The beer was warm—probably been in Bobby's truck all day—but Lisa didn't care. It gave her something to do with her hands.

"My grandmother and yours were friends," Bobby said finally. "Did you know that?"

Lisa shook her head.

"Yeah. Grew up together. Went to school together. They used to swim every morning, before work. My grandmother worked at the cannery, your grandmother..." He paused. "I don't remember what she did."

"Waitress," Lisa said quietly. "At the old diner. The one that burned down in '62."

Bobby nodded. "Right. Anyway, they were close. After Marie died, my grandmother stopped swimming. Stopped going to the beach at all. I didn't understand why when I was a kid. She'd say the gulf took Marie and she wasn't giving it anyone else."

Lisa felt her throat tighten. "She knew."

"Not knew, exactly. But she suspected something wasn't right. The way it happened, the timing, how good a swimmer Marie was. It didn't add up. But what could she do? Sheriff ruled it accidental. No evidence. No witnesses." Bobby took a long drink. "She died thinking Marie drowned. But I think part of her always wondered."

"My great-grandmother too," Lisa said. "She never believed it was an accident."

"Families know," Bobby said. "Even when nobody listens."

They sat quietly. Outside, the gulf whispered against the shore. That same sound had been there the night Marie died. The night Cyrus Wade held her underwater until she stopped fighting. The gulf had witnessed it all and kept the secret.

"I'm sorry," Bobby said. "About your grandmother. About all of it."

"It's not your fault."

"Cyrus is from here. He's one of us. The town protected him, even if they didn't know what he was doing. We're all complicit."

Lisa looked at him. Bobby's face was drawn, exhausted. He blamed himself, she realized. For being part of Emerald Bay. For not seeing what was happening. For knowing Cyrus his whole life and never suspecting.

"You were a kid," Lisa said. "You couldn't have known."

"Maybe. But I'm not a kid now. And tomorrow we're going to stop him."

"Tomorrow." Lisa looked down at the Polaroid again. Tomorrow they'd set a trap. Tomorrow Cyrus might try to kill Carter. Tomorrow they'd catch a serial killer who'd operated for twenty-one years.

Tomorrow she'd get justice for Marie.

"I need to be there," Lisa said. "When we catch him. I need him to know what he took from my family."

Bobby nodded. "Marcus already said you're part of the plan. Shore lookout with Jillian, camera duty."

"That's not enough." Lisa set down her beer, met Bobby's eyes. "I need to face him. Look him in the eye. Tell him what he did."

"Lisa—"

"My mother grew up without a mother because of him. My great-grandmother died thinking it was her fault for not being there that morning. Three generations of my family have been hurt by what he did. I deserve to confront him."

Bobby was quiet for a long moment. "You're right. But it's going to be dangerous. When we grab him, when he realizes he's caught, he might fight. Might try to run. Marcus and I will have him in the water, but getting him to shore, restraining him..."

"I can handle it."

"I know you can. You're tougher than you look." Bobby gave her a small smile. "Your grandmother was too, according to mine. Didn't take shit from anyone."

Lisa felt a lump in her throat. She'd never known Marie, only seen old photographs and heard stories. In the pictures, Marie was always smiling—at the beach, at her wedding, holding baby Lisa's mother. She looked happy. Full of life.

Cyrus had stolen that. Stolen Marie's future, her daughter's childhood, the grandmother Lisa never got to know.

"I want him to suffer," Lisa said quietly. "Is that wrong?"

"No," Bobby said. "It's human."

"I keep thinking about what Marcus said. About Cyrus believing he's righteous. That he's serving Caroline, purifying the gulf. He thinks he's the good guy."

"He's insane."

"But he's not, really. Jillian said he's organized, functional. He runs a business. He acts normal. He just has this one... delusion. And that delusion has killed forty-seven people."

Bobby shook his head. "Don't try to understand him. Don't try to sympathize. He's a monster, even if he doesn't think he is."

"I'm not sympathizing. I just..." Lisa struggled to find the words. "I want him to understand what he did. I want him to know Marie wasn't a sinner who deserved to die. She was a person. A mother. She mattered."

"He won't care," Bobby said gently. "People like Cyrus, they can't see past their own reality. You could tell him everything and he'd still think he was right."

"I know. But I need to try."

The shed door opened again. This time it was Marcus, with Jillian behind him. They both looked exhausted.

"Photos are buried," Marcus said. "Marked the spot. If anything happens tomorrow, the evidence will survive."

Jillian saw Lisa's face and crossed to her immediately. "Hey. You okay?"

"No," Lisa said honestly. "But I will be. After tomorrow."

Marcus came closer, studying her. "You don't have to be there tomorrow. I know you said you wanted to, but if it's too much—"

"I'm going to be there." Lisa's voice was firm. "Not just as lookout. I want to face him when we catch him. I want him to know about Marie."

"Lisa—"

"Marcus, please." Lisa stood, facing him. "He killed my grandmother. I deserve to confront him."

Marcus exchanged glances with Jillian and Bobby. Finally, he nodded. "Okay. But you stay back until we have him secured. Bobby and I will get him out of the water, restrain him on the beach. Then you can say what you need to say. Deal?"

"Deal."

"Good." Marcus checked his watch. "It's almost two AM. Everyone needs sleep. Tomorrow's going to be intense."

They filed out of the shed. Bobby walked toward his truck, still carrying his beer. Jillian linked her arm through Lisa's as they headed toward their rooms.

"You sure about this?" Jillian asked quietly. "Confronting him?"

"I have to," Lisa said. "For Marie. For my mom. For me."

"Then we'll make sure you get the chance."

They reached Lisa's door. Jillian gave her a quick hug. "Try to sleep. Tomorrow we end this."

Lisa went inside, closed the door, leaned against it. The room was dark except for the moonlight through the window. She could hear the gulf, that eternal whisper. How many times had Marie heard that same sound? How many mornings had she walked to the beach, never knowing one day she wouldn't come back?

Lisa crossed to the window, looked out at the dark water. Somewhere out there, Cyrus Wade was probably asleep in his houseboat. Dreaming of Caroline. Believing he was righteous.

Tomorrow, that would end.

"I'm doing this for you, Grandma," Lisa whispered to the night. "You deserved better. You all did."

The gulf whispered back, keeping its secrets. But not for much longer.

Lisa climbed into bed, still dressed, and closed her eyes. Sleep came eventually, filled with dreams of a young woman she'd never met—dark hair, bright smile, walking into gentle waves as the sun rose over the gulf.
