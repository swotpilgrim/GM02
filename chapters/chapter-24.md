# Chapter 24: Confession

County jail, thirty miles inland. Marcus sat in the observation room watching Cyrus Wade confess. Agent Reeves had invited them—earned the right to witness.

Cyrus sat calmly, hands folded, serene. Orange jail scrubs too big on his frame, worn like vestments.

Camera recording. Two FBI agents across from Cyrus. Reeves in observation with the group.

"You've waived your right to an attorney?"

"I understand. I want to tell my story. People need to know the truth about Caroline and the sacred gulf."

"Let's start at the beginning. Tell us about your wife."

"Caroline Maria Wade. Met her 1955, Pensacola. Most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. Married six months later."

"She drowned in 1957?"

"Returned to the waters. August 14, 1957. Swimming at sunset. The current took her. Body found three days later."

"But you don't believe it was accidental."

"The gulf took her. She loved the water. The gulf needed her. She became part of it. Sacred."

Jillian shook her head. "Magical thinking. Trauma into mythology."

"After Caroline died?"

"Lost. Broken. Then April 1958, I heard her voice. Sitting on the beach at midnight, considering ending it. I heard her. 'Mi amor, I have need of you.'"

"What did she say?"

"Tourists were defiling her resting place. Trash, disrespect, mockery. Each disrespect caused pain. She asked me to purify the waters. Send the sinners to her, cleansed."

"And you believed this voice was really Caroline?"

"I know it was." Cyrus's conviction was absolute. "She speaks to me still. Every night when I pray, she responds. She thanks me for my service. She's pleased with my work."

"The first one?"

"Robert Jameson. June 21, 1958. Birmingham businessman. Watched three days—saw him urinate in the gulf, throw bottles, call Emerald Bay a shithole. Disrespected Caroline."

"How?"

"Offered free lessons. Took him out at dusk. Forty feet. Grabbed his ankles, held him down. Two minutes. Released. Body floated. Natural drowning."

Marcus's stomach turned. Murder described like a recipe.

"How did you feel?"

"Relieved. Fulfilled. Caroline thanked me in a dream. Water was purer. Holy work."

"And you continued."

"Of course. Caroline needed me. Sinners kept coming. Every summer, hundreds disrespecting the gulf. I selected the worst ones. The ones Caroline identified."

"How did Caroline identify them?"

"Whispered names when I prayed. Pointed me toward them. Sometimes I'd dream of someone, wake knowing they needed purification. Other times I'd feel her presence near the disrespectful. I learned the signs."

Bobby leaned close to Marcus. "He's completely gone. There's nobody home behind those eyes."

Marcus nodded. Cyrus spoke with the certainty of a prophet. No doubt. No remorse. Just absolute conviction that he'd done the right thing.

The agent was taking notes. "Walk us through your methodology. How did you select victims, approach them, execute the drownings?"

"I'd watch first. Confirm the disrespect. Usually two or three days of observation. Document their sins in my journals so Caroline could see I was being thorough. Then I'd approach offering free equipment or advice—I've run Wade's Gulf Diving since 1962, so it was natural for me to help tourists. I'd take them out in the water, wait for the right moment, then send them to Caroline. The ankle grab works best—they can't get leverage to fight back. Hold them down two to three minutes depending on their strength. Release. Surface nearby, 'discover' the body, call for help. Traumatized local business owner who tried to save them. Never suspected."

"Forty-seven times," the agent said. "You did this forty-seven times."

"Forty-seven purifications," Cyrus corrected. "Forty-seven sinners cleansed and sent to Caroline. The gulf is purer for my service."

"Did you ever feel guilty?"

"Why would I?" Cyrus looked genuinely confused. "I was serving divine purpose. Caroline needed me. The gulf needed me. Those people were causing harm through their disrespect. I fixed it. Purified the waters. How is that wrong?"

Lisa was crying silently in the observation room. Jillian had an arm around her. Carter looked sick. Bobby's hands were clenched into fists.

Marcus just felt cold. Listening to Cyrus describe murder as holy work, with no more emotion than someone describing their job, was deeply disturbing.

The interrogation continued for another hour. The agents walked Cyrus through specific murders—dates, names, methods. He remembered every one. Forty-seven people over twenty-one years, and he could recall details about each drowning. The journals weren't just documentation—they were devotional texts. Records of his service to his dead wife.

Finally, Agent Reeves turned to the group. "You've heard enough?"

They nodded. None of them wanted to hear more.

"He'll confess to everything," Reeves said. "Won't even try to defend himself. His public defender will probably argue insanity—delusional disorder, not guilty by reason of mental defect. But the prosecution will counter with his functionality, his planning, his ability to evade detection for decades. They'll say he knew what he was doing was illegal, he just didn't care. The jury will have to decide."

"Will he get the death penalty?" Carter asked.

"Florida has capital punishment. Multiple premeditated murders over two decades? Yes, the prosecution will seek death. But it'll be years of appeals. He might die of old age before execution."

"He's fifty-eight," Marcus said. "Could be on death row for twenty years."

"Or life without parole if the jury shows mercy. Either way, he'll never leave prison."

They watched through the glass as the agents concluded the interview. Cyrus looked peaceful. Content. He'd told his story. He'd explained his holy mission. In his twisted mind, people would understand now. See that he'd done nothing wrong. That he'd served Caroline faithfully for twenty-one years.

The delusion was complete.

"Let's go," Marcus said quietly. "I can't watch this anymore."

They filed out of the observation room, leaving Cyrus Wade to his confession. In the parking lot, the afternoon sun was blindingly bright after the dim interior.

"I need a drink," Carter said.

"It's three PM," Jillian pointed out.

"I don't care."

They found a bar off the highway, nearly empty on a weekday afternoon. Ordered beers and sat in a booth, processing what they'd witnessed.

"He really believes it," Lisa said. "That's what's so terrifying. He genuinely thinks he did the right thing."

"That's how delusions work," Jillian said. "Once the false belief is established, everything gets filtered through it. Every killing reinforced his worldview. Caroline was pleased. The gulf was purer. He was serving divine purpose. The delusion became his reality."

"How does someone get that broken?" Bobby asked.

"Grief, isolation, probable underlying mental illness. Caroline's death shattered him. Instead of processing the trauma normally, he constructed an elaborate mythology to give her death meaning. She didn't just drown—she became part of the sacred gulf. She wasn't gone—she was still there, in the water, speaking to him. And he could serve her by protecting her domain."

"And nobody stopped him," Marcus said bitterly. "Twenty-one years. Forty-seven murders. The sheriff's department ruled every single one accidental."

"They didn't want to look closer," Carter said. "Bad for tourism."

They sat in silence, drinking. Outside, traffic passed on the highway. Normal people doing normal things. None of them knowing that a serial killer had just confessed to decades of murders thirty miles away.

"What happens now?" Lisa asked.

"Trial," Marcus said. "Probably a year from now, maybe longer. We'll have to testify. All of us. They'll want to establish the pattern, the investigation, the capture. We'll be subpoenaed."

"I want to testify," Lisa said. "I want to look at a jury and tell them about my grandmother. Make them understand these weren't just statistics. These were people. Marie was a person."

"You'll get your chance," Jillian promised.

They finished their beers and drove back to Emerald Bay in silence. The Sandpiper Resort looked desolate—more guests had checked out, the parking lot nearly empty. The few remaining tourists watched them park, whispered to each other. Word had spread. The kids who'd caught the serial killer.

Marcus didn't want fame. Didn't want attention. He just wanted the summer to be over so he could go back to college, back to normal life, back to a world where serial killers stayed in the abstract.

"I'm leaving tomorrow," Carter announced. "Heading back to Atlanta. I can't stay here."

"I don't blame you," Marcus said. "This place is poisoned now."

"You guys?"

"I'm here through August," Marcus said. "Have to finish the summer. Kowalski's still paying me even though the resort's dying."

"My family's leaving," Bobby said. "Grandma wants to move to her sister's in Georgia. Can't stay in Emerald Bay knowing what Cyrus did. Knowing the whole town looked the other way."

"I'm going to Tallahassee," Lisa said. "Jillian helped me apply to community college. Fresh start."

They made plans to stay in touch. Exchanged phone numbers and addresses. Promised to meet up when the trial happened. It felt like the end of something—not just the investigation, but their brief community of purpose.

They'd come together as strangers. Now they'd be bound forever by what they'd experienced. What they'd survived. What they'd stopped.

Marcus walked Lisa back to her room as the sun set, painting the gulf in oranges and purples. The same colors that had been there the night Marie drowned. The night of every drowning. Beautiful and deadly.

"Thank you," Lisa said at her door. "For believing me when I said something was wrong. For not giving up."

"We all did it together."

"But you started it. You kept pushing when everyone else accepted the accidents. Marie—all of them—they got justice because you wouldn't let it go."

Marcus didn't know how to respond. He'd just done what seemed right. Followed the evidence. Refused to accept an explanation that didn't fit.

"Get some rest," he said finally. "Tomorrow's a new day."

Lisa smiled—sad but genuine. "Yeah. A day without Cyrus Wade killing people. That's something."

Marcus walked back to his room alone. Tomorrow Carter would leave. Soon Bobby and Lisa would follow. The resort would close. The summer would end. Life would move forward.

But forty-seven families would still have empty chairs at their tables. Forty-seven people would still be dead. And Cyrus Wade would sit in prison, probably still believing he'd done holy work, still hearing Caroline's voice thanking him for his service.

Justice didn't bring anyone back. It didn't heal the wounds. It just ensured the killer couldn't hurt anyone else.

Sometimes that had to be enough.

Marcus lay in bed listening to the gulf whisper against the shore. The same sound Cyrus had heard every night for twenty-one years. The same sound that had driven him deeper into delusion, convincing him his dead wife spoke through the waves.

Some mysteries stayed mysteries.

But this one, at least, had an ending.
