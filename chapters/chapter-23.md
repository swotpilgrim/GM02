# Chapter 23: Beach Confrontation

The sheriff's station was squat concrete, institutional beige, three blocks from the beach. Marcus sat in an uncomfortable plastic chair, waiting his turn. The clock read 8:47 PM. Three hours here already.

Carter had gone first—ninety minutes recounting his role as bait, Cyrus's hand on his ankle, the terror before Marcus and Bobby reached him. The deputy had to stop twice so Carter could compose himself.

Bobby was being interviewed now. Marcus could hear his voice through the walls, steady and factual.

Jillian sat across from Marcus, flipping through a magazine without reading it. Lisa dozed in the chair next to her, head on Jillian's shoulder, exhausted from crying and adrenaline crash. Marcus was glad she was sleeping. She'd been through enough today.

The front door opened. A man in a suit—FBI badge, Special Agent Reeves. "I understand you have a serial homicide case."

The sergeant led him back. FBI arrived fast. Morrison must have called immediately.

Marcus leaned back, closed his eyes. Ribs ached where Cyrus had elbowed him. Shoulders burned. Every muscle used up. But they'd stopped a serial killer who'd operated twenty-one years.

Victory felt hollow.

"Marcus Chen?" A deputy stood in the doorway—Deputy Chen, ironically. Young, maybe twenty-five, with kind eyes. "We're ready for your statement."

Interview room. Tape recorder, legal pad. Chen pressed record.

Marcus started from the beginning. The drownings. His suspicions. The group investigating when the sheriff ruled everything accidental. Weighted ropes. Connection to Cyrus Wade.

Breaking into the houseboat—Chen's eyebrows rose. Journals documenting forty-seven murders. Shrine to Caroline. Lisa's grandmother's entry.

The plan. Carter as bait. Underwater positioning. Watching Cyrus stalk. The tackle. The struggle. Shore.

Chen asked clarifying questions. Times. Positions. Cyrus's exact words. The dive knife. Whether Marcus feared for Carter's life—absolutely. Whether Cyrus would have killed Carter—no question.

Forty-five minutes. Chen stopped the recording.

"That's one hell of a story," he said quietly. "Most detailed civilian investigation I've ever seen."

"We didn't have a choice," Marcus said. "Your department wasn't doing anything."

"Is Cyrus still confessing?"

"Won't shut up. All forty-seven murders, dates, victims, methods. FBI asked if he wanted a lawyer—Cyrus laughed. Wants everyone to know about his mission. Caroline, the gulf, purification." Chen paused. "He's completely insane."

"But competent to stand trial?"

"FBI psychologist says yes. Delusional but understands right from wrong. Thinks he was right. That makes him fit to stand trial."

Good. Justice, not a psychiatric hospital.

"How'd you know?" Chen asked. "What made you keep digging?"

"I'm a lifeguard. Third summer here. Know the water. Know drownings. The circumstances were wrong. Strong swimmers, calm water, identical bruising, too many too fast. Didn't add up."

"Nobody listened."

"No."

Chen opened the door. "You did good work. Probably saved lives."

Marcus walked back to the waiting area. Bobby was there now, looking drained. Jillian was gently waking Lisa.

"Your turn," Marcus told her. "Lisa, you're up next."

Lisa blinked awake, remembered, face hardening. She followed a deputy back. Hardest statement—personal connection, confronting the killer, the slap.

Twenty minutes later, Sheriff Morrison emerged with the FBI agent. Morrison looked aged. The agent looked satisfied.

"Statements complete. You're free to go. We'll need you for trial testimony eventually."

"What about Cyrus?" Carter asked.

"Being transferred to county lockup tonight. FBI has jurisdiction since this crosses multiple years and potentially multiple jurisdictions. Agent Reeves will be lead investigator." Morrison paused. "For what it's worth... you kids did what we should've done years ago. Can't change the past. But you gave those families answers. That matters."

"Forty-seven families shouldn't have needed those answers," Jillian said coldly.

Morrison had no response. He walked away, shoulders hunched, looking defeated. The FBI agent watched him go, then approached the group.

"Agent Reeves," he introduced himself. "FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. I'll be coordinating the investigation into Cyrus Wade's homicides. I've reviewed your evidence photographs and statements. Impressive work. Most civilians wouldn't have thought to document so thoroughly."

"We wanted to make sure he couldn't wiggle out of it," Bobby said.

"He won't. His confession is admissible—he was read his rights, understood them, waived counsel voluntarily. The journals are physical evidence we can seize under warrant. And we have thirty-plus eyewitnesses to today's attempted murder." Reeves pulled out business cards, handed them out. "You'll each be called to testify at trial. Probably won't be for a year, minimum. Wade will almost certainly plead guilty—he wants people to know what he did. But we'll need your testimony to establish the pattern, the investigation, the capture."

"We'll be there," Marcus said.

Reeves nodded. "One more thing. The media is outside. News crews from Jacksonville, Tallahassee, even Atlanta. This is a big story—serial killer operating in a tourist area for two decades. You don't have to talk to them if you don't want to. But if you do, stick to the facts. Don't speculate about supernatural elements or local conspiracy theories. Just facts."

"Supernatural elements?" Carter asked.

"Wade keeps talking about his dead wife speaking to him from the gulf. The weeping woman legend. Some reporters are already playing up the ghost angle. Don't feed that narrative. This is about a delusional man who murdered dozens of people, not about ghosts."

They nodded. Reeves left, and they sat in silence for a moment, processing.

"Media," Jillian finally said. "Great."

"We don't have to talk to them," Marcus said. "Let's just go."

They filed out the station's side door, trying to avoid the cameras. But the reporters spotted them anyway—a surge of people with microphones and cameras, shouting questions.

"Are you the ones who caught him?"

"How many people did he kill?"

"Is it true he thought his dead wife was talking to him?"

"Did you really break into his house?"

"Why didn't the police catch him sooner?"

Marcus kept walking, not answering. Bobby and Carter flanked Lisa and Jillian, creating a barrier. The reporters followed for half a block before giving up.

They reached Carter's Trans Am, parked on a side street. All five of them squeezed in—tight, uncomfortable, but nobody wanted to be alone. Carter drove slowly back toward the Sandpiper, the radio off, everyone lost in their own thoughts.

The resort looked strange in the darkness. Empty. Word had spread—half the guests had checked out already, spooked by the news. The ones who remained watched from their windows, curtains twitching, as the group walked to their rooms.

"We should talk," Jillian said. "Process this. Not alone."

"Beach?" Bobby suggested. "Seems appropriate."

They dropped off their things and met on the sand fifteen minutes later. The gulf stretched out dark and calm, stars reflecting on the water. The same gulf that had claimed forty-seven lives. The same gulf Cyrus Wade believed was sacred, that needed purification, that spoke to him through his dead wife's voice.

It looked peaceful. Beautiful. Innocent.

Lisa sat on the sand, hugging her knees. "Is it over? Really over?"

"He's in custody," Marcus said. "FBI has the case. He confessed. Yeah, it's over."

"It doesn't feel over."

"I know."

They sat in silence, listening to the waves. After a while, Carter spoke. "I thought I was going to die. When I felt his hand on my ankle, just for a second before you guys got there—I knew what was happening. I was going to drown. Just like the others."

"But you didn't," Bobby said. "We got him."

"If you'd been two seconds slower..."

"But we weren't."

More silence. Then Jillian: "How many people did he kill that we don't know about? The journals went back to 1958. That's forty-seven documented. But what about before? What about ones he didn't write down?"

"Don't," Marcus said. "That way lies madness. We stopped him. That's what matters."

"My grandmother was one name in a journal," Lisa said quietly. "One entry. 'Purified in shallow waters.' Like she was trash. Like her life meant nothing."

"Her life meant everything," Jillian said fiercely. "To your mom, to your great-grandmother, to you. Cyrus was insane. His opinion doesn't matter."

"But she's still dead."

"Yeah. She is. And that's not fair and it's not right and nothing we did today changes that. But at least now you know the truth. At least her death won't be forgotten as just another accident."

Lisa wiped her eyes. "I keep thinking about the slap. I shouldn't have done that."

"Yes, you should have," Bobby said. "He deserved worse."

"The deputy said I could be charged with assault."

"You won't be," Marcus said. "No prosecutor would touch that. You'd just become a sympathetic victim and Cyrus would become more sympathetic too. They'll ignore it."

"Did you see his face after? He was smiling. I slapped him and he smiled."

"Because he's completely delusional," Jillian said. "He thinks he did nothing wrong. He probably thought you were acting out of grief for your 'purified' grandmother. In his twisted worldview, he did Marie a favor."

"I hate him," Lisa whispered. "I've never hated anyone before. But I hate him so much."

"That's okay," Marcus said. "That's normal. He murdered your grandmother. Hate is appropriate."

They stayed on the beach until after midnight, talking through everything, processing the day. Eventually, exhaustion won. They walked back to the resort together, splitting up to their individual rooms with promises to meet for breakfast.

Marcus lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Cyrus's pale blue eyes staring up from underwater, focused and intent, reaching for Carter's ankle. Predatory. Patient. Convinced of his righteousness.

They'd stopped him. But how many Cyrus Wades were out there, operating unnoticed, killing with impunity because authorities didn't want to look too closely?

Marcus's last thought before sleep took him was of the gulf, whispering against the shore, keeping its secrets even now.

Some mysteries stayed mysteries.

But at least this one had an ending.
