# Chapter 20: The Plan

Morning came too quickly. Marcus woke at seven, having slept maybe four hours. By the time gray light filtered through his window, he'd mentally rehearsed the trap a dozen times.

Bobby was already at the shed, spreading a hand-drawn map on the workbench. Beach section, gulf waters, weighted rope locations marked.

"Couldn't sleep either?"

"Nope. Been thinking about positioning." Bobby tapped the map. "If Cyrus approaches from the houseboat, his angle means we need to be north and south of Carter, not east-west."

Marcus studied the map. Bobby was right. "Better coverage. If he sees one of us, the other can intercept."

The shed door opened. Carter stumbled in, looking rough. His hair stuck up at odd angles, his eyes were bloodshot, and he was still wearing yesterday's clothes.

"Morning," he croaked. "Coffee?"

"There's a pot in the resort kitchen," Marcus said. "But drink it fast. We need to run through this before we execute."

"What time are we doing this?"

"Five PM," Bobby said. "Sunset's at 6:47. We want it late enough for low light but early enough that there are still a few people on the beach. Witnesses help our case."

Jillian arrived next, looking more put-together than Carter but still tired. She had her notebook and was already making lists. "Equipment check. What do we need?"

Marcus started counting on his fingers. "Snorkel gear for Bobby and me. Masks, fins, snorkels. Dark wetsuits if we can find them—we need to blend with the seagrass. Knives, waterproof, in case we need to cut the weighted ropes or defend ourselves. Flare gun for emergency signals. Waterproof watches to sync timing. Camera for Jillian and Lisa."

"The resort has snorkel gear we can borrow," Jillian said. "I'll sign it out officially, say I'm taking tourists on an evening dive. Wetsuits too—there are some in the equipment shed. Camera's trickier. Best we have is Carter's Polaroid, but that's been taking evidence photos. We need something else."

"I've got my dad's 35mm in my truck," Bobby offered. "It's old but it works. Problem is we won't have the photos developed immediately."

"That's fine," Marcus said. "The point is documentation. We can develop the film after Cyrus is in custody."

Lisa appeared in the doorway, looking small but determined. She'd pulled her hair back tight, wore practical clothes—jeans, a t-shirt, sneakers. Ready for action.

"Morning," she said quietly. "What can I do?"

"Help me inventory equipment," Jillian said. "We need to make sure everything's ready before this afternoon."

For the next hour, they worked methodically. Bobby retrieved his camera. Jillian signed out snorkel equipment. Carter practiced his drunk routine—painfully convincing.

Marcus found two dive knives, strapped one to his calf, gave the other to Bobby. Reassuring weight. If Cyrus fought harder than expected...

At nine AM, they gathered around the map.

"Let's walk through it step by step," Marcus said. "Carter, you start."

Carter pointed to a spot on the beach. "I show up around four-thirty. Find a good spot in the kill zone, the area where most of Cyrus's drownings have happened. I set up—beach towel, cooler with beer, radio playing music. I'm loud. I'm obnoxious. I complain about the resort, the beach, the water."

"Be specific," Marcus said. "What kind of complaints?"

"Beach is dirty. Water smells weird. Locals are unfriendly. Tourist trap, should've gone to Destin." Carter ticked them off. "Around five, I wade into the water. I'm drinking, acting drunk. I toss my empty beer can toward the water—"

"Where Lisa retrieves it immediately," Jillian cut in. "We don't actually want to litter."

"Right. But Cyrus needs to see me do it. Then I go deeper. Wade out to chest-deep water, splashing around, being disrespectful. Making a scene."

"Bobby and I are already in position." Marcus pointed. "Submerged since four-forty-five, breathing through snorkels, low in the seagrass. From Cyrus's angle, he won't see us."

"What if he spots you?" Lisa asked.

"We surface and confront him before he reaches Carter. Not ideal, but we still have him stalking with dive gear. Combined with journals, enough."

"Jillian and Lisa are on the beach," Marcus continued, pointing. "Here, with the camera. You're pretending to be tourists enjoying the sunset. Every time something significant happens—Carter entering the water, Cyrus approaching, the actual attack—you photograph it."

"What about other people on the beach?" Jillian asked. "Real tourists?"

"That's actually helpful," Marcus said. "Witnesses. As long as they're not in the immediate danger zone, they support our case."

Carter was pacing now, nervous energy. "So I'm in the water, chest-deep, drunk-acting. Cyrus sees me from his houseboat or the shop. He decides I'm a sinner. Then what?"

"Based on the journals, he'll watch you for a bit," Bobby said. "Confirm the behavior. Then he'll close the shop or leave the houseboat, get his dive gear. He'll enter the water away from you—probably here." He pointed to a spot fifty yards down the beach. "He'll put on fins and mask underwater, where you can't see. Then he'll swim toward you, staying deep."

"And that's when we see him," Marcus said. "We're watching Carter, but we're also watching the approach vectors. The second we identify Cyrus in the water with gear, we prepare to move."

"How close do you let him get?" Carter asked, and Marcus heard the edge in his voice. This was the scary part. They were using Carter as bait, and no matter how much they planned, there was risk.

"Close enough to establish intent. He reaches for your ankles, we move. Bobby high, I go low. Two directions simultaneously."

"And if he's faster?"

"He won't be. Surprise is everything."

Bobby cracked his knuckles. "I can take him. He's fifty-eight. I'm nineteen. Youth and adrenaline. And I'm pissed."

Marcus believed him. Bobby looked focused. Dangerous.

"Once we have him, we bring him to the surface," Marcus continued. "Bobby controls his upper body, I have his legs. We swim him to shore. He'll fight—expect that. Stay calm, stay coordinated. Get him on the beach, face-down in the sand, hold him there."

"That's when I come in," Lisa said softly.

Everyone looked at her.

"I need to face him," Lisa said. "Before the cops come. I need him to know about Marie."

Marcus exchanged glances with Jillian. They'd discussed this last night. He wasn't thrilled about Lisa getting close to Cyrus, but he understood. She deserved that moment.

"Okay," Marcus said. "But only after Bobby and I have him completely restrained. And you don't get closer than five feet. Deal?"

"Deal."

"Then Jillian calls the sheriff from the resort," Marcus said. "We have witnesses, we have photographs, we have Cyrus caught in the act. The journals are already buried as backup evidence. Case closed."

They stood in silence for a moment, studying the map. The plan was solid. They'd accounted for variables. But plans never survived contact with reality, and they were going up against a man who'd successfully murdered forty-seven people.

"What could go wrong?" Carter asked, voicing what they were all thinking.

"Lots," Marcus admitted. "Cyrus doesn't take the bait. He sees us in the water. He's faster than we anticipate. He has a weapon we don't know about. Another tourist gets in the way. Weather changes. Equipment fails."

"Reassuring."

"But we've planned for the likeliest scenarios," Marcus said. "And we're not alone. There's five of us. Cyrus is one person. Even if something goes sideways, we have numbers, we have evidence, we have witnesses. We'll adapt."

Jillian was making notes. "We should have a signal. If something goes wrong, if anyone needs to abort, we need a way to communicate."

"Whistle. Three short blasts. If you hear it, surface immediately, abort, get Carter out."

"Good. I'll get whistles. What else?"

"Hospital," Lisa said. "What if someone gets hurt?"

"Thirty miles inland," Bobby said. "Forty-five minutes response."

"We'll be careful. Cyrus isn't armed. We restrain, not hurt. Anyone injured, we stabilize and get them help. Plan continues with whoever's left."

Carter sat down heavily on the bucket. "This is really happening. We're really going to catch a serial killer this afternoon."

"Yes," Marcus said simply.

"And if we fail? If he gets away?"

"Then we go to the sheriff with the buried photographs and hope he takes us seriously. But I don't think we'll fail."

Bobby folded the map carefully. "Cyrus has been doing this for twenty-one years. He thinks he's untouchable. That makes him overconfident. He'll take the bait."

"How can you be sure?" Jillian asked.

"Because Carter is perfect." Bobby looked at him. "Rich, obnoxious, disrespectful tourist. Exactly the type Cyrus hates. The type Caroline supposedly wants punished. He won't be able to resist."

Carter looked queasy. "Great. I'm irresistible to a serial killer."

"You're brave," Lisa said. "You're risking yourself to stop him. That matters."

The group fell quiet. Morning light streamed through the shed's gaps, dust motes floating in the beams. In eight hours, they'd execute the plan. In eight hours, either Cyrus Wade would be in custody, or they'd all be in serious danger.

Marcus checked his watch. "It's nine-thirty. Everyone needs to eat, stay hydrated, rest if you can. Meet back here at three PM for final equipment check and positioning. Bobby, you and I will go to the beach early, get in position. Carter, you arrive at four-thirty exactly. Jillian, Lisa, you're there by four-forty-five with the camera. Everyone clear?"

Nods around the shed.

"Then let's do this right. For Marie. For all of them."

They dispersed slowly. Carter headed to the resort for breakfast and probably more coffee. Jillian and Lisa walked toward the equipment shed to organize the snorkel gear. Bobby lingered with Marcus.

"You really think this'll work?" Bobby asked.

"It has to," Marcus said. "We're not getting another chance."

Bobby nodded, then walked out into the bright morning. Marcus stood alone in the shed, looking at the map. The plan was solid. They'd trained, prepared, accounted for variables. But underneath it all, one truth remained: they were putting Carter's life at risk. If something went wrong, if Cyrus was faster or more violent than expected, Carter could die.

Marcus folded the map and put it in his pocket. They'd be careful. They'd be smart. And they'd end this today.

One way or another.
