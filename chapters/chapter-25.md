# Chapter 25: The Evidence

Media descended like locusts. News vans from Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Atlanta, New York. Reporters everywhere. Marcus avoided them.

Three days after the arrest, Agent Reeves held a press conference. Marcus watched from the empty tiki bar. Jillian and Bobby with him. Lisa home with her mother. Carter in Atlanta.

Reeves stood at a podium, FBI seal behind him, looking professional and grim. "After a thorough investigation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has confirmed that Cyrus Wade,  fifty-eight, of Emerald Bay, Florida, is responsible for at least forty-seven homicides spanning from 1958 to 1979. Mr. Wade has confessed to all forty-seven murders and provided detailed documentation of his crimes."

The reporters erupted with questions. Reeves held up a hand.

"Wade targeted tourists he believed disrespected the Gulf. Approached offering lessons, then drowned them using diving expertise. Initially ruled accidental by local authorities."

"Why weren't they investigated as murders earlier?"

"Significant failures at the local level. Being reviewed. Being addressed."

Heads would roll.

"Did he think his dead wife talked to him?"

"Delusional disorder with religious themes. Believed his wife drowned in 1957 was communicating from the Gulf, directing him to 'purify' waters. Competent to stand trial."

"Death penalty?"

"Given the number of victims and premeditation, capital punishment is being considered."

Marcus turned off the television. He didn't want to hear more. The facts were laid out now. Public record. Cyrus Wade, serial killer, forty-seven victims, two decades of murder disguised as accidents.

"They're not mentioning us by name," Jillian noted. "'Resort workers who noticed patterns.' That's us."

"Good," Marcus said. "I don't want to be famous for this."

"Too late," Bobby said, pointing to a car pulling into the parking lot. News crew. They'd found them.

They slipped out the back before the reporters could corner them.

Later that afternoon, Marcus drove to the county forensics lab. Agent Reeves had invited him to see the physical evidence before it was locked away. Said he deserved to see how thorough Cyrus had been.

The lab was in the basement of the county courthouse, fluorescent-lit and sterile. A technician led Marcus to a long table where items were laid out in labeled bags.

"The journals," the technician said, indicating six leather-bound books. "Six volumes spanning 1958 to 1979. Three hundred and twelve pages total. Forty-seven detailed homicide entries, plus additional pages of prayers and devotional writing to his deceased wife."

Marcus looked at the journals through the clear plastic evidence bags. Cyrus's neat handwriting filled every page. Blue ink. Straight lines. Methodical documentation of murder.

"The shrine materials," the technician continued, moving down the table. "Sixty-three waterlogged dolls of varying ages and origins. Some date to the 1930s based on manufacturing methods. We're not sure where he acquired those—possibly antique shops, possibly they washed up on the beach. He arranged them facing a portrait of his wife, like an altar."

The dolls looked even more disturbing under fluorescent lights. Rotted fabric, cracked faces, empty eye sockets staring at nothing.

"Newspaper clippings. Forty-seven articles about drowning deaths in the Emerald Bay area, each circled in red ink, dating 1958 to 1979."

"Personal items." Small evidence bags—a watch, a wedding ring, a bracelet, a pendant. "Trophies taken from seven victims. We've confirmed ownership through family members. These items were reported missing after the drownings."

Marcus felt sick looking at them. Seven families who'd lost someone and also lost a precious memento. Now evidence in a murder case.

"And this is the interesting part," the technician said, moving to the end of the table. "The houseboat itself. We processed it for evidence and found...anomalies."

"What kind of anomalies?"

"Water damage in the shrine area that doesn't match any structural problem. Saltwater staining on the floor that appears and disappears. We've had the boat under observation for three days. Every morning around 3 AM, approximately one inch of seawater appears on the floor near where the shrine was located. By dawn, it's gone—evaporated or absorbed, we're not sure. But it keeps happening."

Marcus stared at him. "That's not possible."

"That's what our team said. We've checked everything. No leaks in the hull. No plumbing issues. The boat hasn't moved from its slip. We've tested the water—it's definitely seawater, Gulf salinity. But there's no natural explanation for how it's appearing."

"Maybe Cyrus set up some kind of system. Hidden pipes or—"

"We've torn the boat apart looking for that. There's nothing. The water just...appears. Around 3 AM. Every night. An inch deep. Pools under where Caroline's portrait hung. Then it's gone by morning."

Marcus felt cold despite the warm lab. "Have you told Agent Reeves?"

"He's aware. He's not happy about it, but he's aware. Official stance is it's unexplained but probably has a rational explanation we haven't found yet."

"And unofficial stance?"

The technician shrugged. "Some of us are spooked. Cyrus talked about his wife communicating from the gulf. About her presence in the water. And now we've got seawater appearing impossibly in his boat, right where he kept her shrine. It's...unsettling."

Marcus thanked him and left. Outside, the afternoon sun was too bright, the air too hot. He sat in his car for a long time, processing what he'd learned.

The physical evidence was overwhelming. Journals, trophies, confession, documentation. Cyrus Wade would be convicted. There was no question.

But the water. The impossible saltwater appearing every night.

Marcus drove to the library, a small brick building near the center of Emerald Bay. The librarian recognized him—everyone in town knew about the group who'd caught Cyrus—and showed him to the local history section.

He found what he was looking for in a book about Gulf Coast folklore published in 1947. A chapter on La Llorona, the weeping woman. The legend dated back centuries in Latin American cultures—a woman who drowned her children and was cursed to wander waterways forever, crying for her lost ones.

But this book had a specific section about Gulf Coast variations. "Local fishermen report hearing a woman crying over the waters near Emerald Bay, particularly during calm nights. The crying is attributed to La Llorona del Golfo, the Weeping Woman of the Gulf, said to be the spirit of a drowned woman who claims those who disrespect her waters."

The book was published in 1947. Ten years before Caroline Wade drowned.

Marcus photocopied the pages and drove back to the Sandpiper. He found Jillian in her room, packing. Everyone was leaving soon. The resort was closing officially at the end of the week.

"Look at this," Marcus said, showing her the photocopies.

Jillian read them, frowning. "La Llorona legends are common throughout Latin America and the Gulf Coast. It's folklore."

"Published in 1947. Before Caroline died."

"So?"

"So Cyrus claimed Caroline spoke to him from the gulf. Told him to purify the waters. What if he didn't make that up? What if there really is something in the gulf—something that was here before Caroline, something she became part of when she drowned?"

Jillian gave him a hard look. "Marcus, you're a rational person. You're a scientist. You know there's no such thing as ghosts or supernatural entities in the water."

"Then explain the saltwater appearing in Cyrus's boat every night. No leaks, no plumbing, no natural explanation. It just appears around 3 AM—the same time Cyrus said Caroline spoke to him during his rituals."

"There's an explanation. We just haven't found it yet."

"Are you sure?"

Jillian was quiet for a moment. "I have to be sure. If I start believing in supernatural explanations, everything I know about science and rationality falls apart. There has to be a natural explanation."

"Even if we never find it?"

"Even then."

Marcus left her packing and walked down to the beach. The sun was setting, painting the gulf in oranges and purples. The same colors that had been there every evening for thousands of years. The same water that had claimed Caroline Wade in 1957, then claimed forty-seven more at the hands of her delusional husband.

Or maybe not so delusional.

Marcus stood at the water's edge, letting small waves lap at his feet. He listened. Really listened.

And maybe—just maybe—he heard it. Very faint, almost lost in the wind and the cry of gulls. A sound like crying. A woman weeping. Or maybe it was just wind through the dunes. He couldn't tell.

Bobby appeared beside him. "Heard you talking to Jillian. About the water in the boat."

"Yeah."

"My grandmother always said there was something in the gulf. The old-timers all believed it. Said you could hear her crying on calm nights. Said she took people who disrespected her."

"You believe that?"

Bobby was quiet for a long time, watching the waves. "I don't know what I believe anymore. A week ago I would've said no, it's just folklore, old superstitions. But then we caught Cyrus. Heard him talk about Caroline speaking to him. And now there's water appearing in his boat with no explanation. So...I don't know."

"Does it matter? Cyrus is in jail. The drownings will stop."

"Will they?" Bobby looked at him. "What if it wasn't just Cyrus? What if there really is something in the gulf that...influenced him? Used him? And now that he's gone, what if it finds someone else?"

"That's not how the world works."

"You sure?"

Marcus wasn't sure. That was the problem. A week ago he would have been certain. Now, standing at the edge of the gulf where forty-seven people had died, listening to what might be wind or might be crying, he wasn't sure of anything.

"We should go," Bobby said. "It's getting dark. And I've had enough of this beach for a lifetime."

They walked back to the resort together. Behind them, the gulf continued its eternal whisper, patient and vast and keeping its secrets.

In the forensics lab thirty miles away, technicians would stay up monitoring Cyrus Wade's houseboat. Around 3 AM, seawater would appear under where Caroline's portrait had hung. They would photograph it, test it, document it. And by morning it would be gone, with no more explanation than it had the night before.

Some mysteries stayed mysteries.

And maybe that was how it was supposed to be.
