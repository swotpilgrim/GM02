# Chapter 2: The First Drowning

The third day started like any other.

Marcus was in the tower by nine, sunscreen already applied, aviator sunglasses cutting the glare off the water. The morning was perfect—high eighties, light breeze, visibility unlimited. The gulf stretched out calm and turquoise. Bathtub conditions.

A dozen tourists dotted the beach. Kids building sandcastles, teenage girls on towels with a transistor radio playing *My Sharona*, a middle-aged couple wading in the shallows.

Marcus watched them all with the practiced eye of three summers' experience. The teenagers weren't swimming—no concern. The kids were supervised. The couple in the water knew how to swim; you could tell by how they moved.

The woman was laughing at something her husband said. Marcus could hear it from the tower, carried on the breeze. They looked happy. Vacation happy.

The whistle was warm in his hand, lanyard around his neck. Marcus settled into the familiar rhythm of the job: scan the water, count heads, check for distress signals, scan again. Every thirty seconds, systematic. Most of lifeguarding was boredom punctuated by brief moments of controlled panic. Three years, he'd had maybe a dozen actual rescues. Mostly kids who'd swum out too far and panicked, or drunk college students who thought they were better swimmers than they were.

Nobody had died on his watch.

The woman's scream cut through the morning like a knife.

Marcus was on his feet before his conscious mind caught up. The woman in the water was thrashing, looking around frantically. The man—her husband—was gone.

Marcus grabbed the rescue float and was running before his brain finished processing. Feet hitting sand, then water, the gulf warm around his knees, his thighs, diving forward into the calm water. Ten seconds since the scream. Fifteen. Every second mattered.

"Where?" Marcus shouted as he reached her. "Where did he go down?"

"Here!" The woman was sobbing, hyperventilating. "Right here! He just—he went under and he didn't come back up!"

Marcus dove. The water was crystal clear, sunlight filtering down in shafts through the turquoise. Eight feet deep, maybe nine. Sandy bottom with occasional patches of seagrass. Visibility perfect—he could see thirty feet in every direction.

The body was there. Face down, arms floating loosely, not moving. Too still.

Marcus's training took over. He grabbed the man under the arms, kicked hard for the surface. The body was heavy, deadweight. Marcus broke the surface gasping, towing the man toward shore. The woman was screaming something incoherent. Other beachgoers were running toward them.

"Carter!" Marcus shouted toward the resort. "Call 911! Now!"

He dragged the man onto the sand, rolled him onto his back. Middle-aged, maybe fifty, gray hair plastered to his skull. Lips already blue. No breathing.

Marcus tilted the head back, checked the airway—clear. Started compressions. The rhythm was automatic, drilled into him by certification. After thirty compressions, he pinched the nose, gave two rescue breaths. The man's chest rose and fell. Back to compressions.

Someone was counting aloud. Marcus kept working, sweat dripping into his eyes, arms burning. Thirty compressions. Two breaths. Come on.

Carter arrived, out of breath. "Ambulance is coming. Twenty minutes."

Too long. But Marcus kept working. The woman was on her knees in the sand, crying. Other tourists formed a loose circle, watching.

Five minutes of CPR. Six. The man's skin was cold, waterlogged. Marcus knew it was too late. But protocol was to continue until medical professionals arrived.

At eight minutes, Marcus sat back on his heels, breathing hard. The man was dead. Had been dead, probably, before Marcus even pulled him from the water.

"Is he..." Carter didn't finish the question.

Marcus shook his head. The woman let out a wail that would haunt his dreams.

---

The sheriff's deputy arrived before the ambulance. Young guy, early twenties, name tag reading "Collins." He took statements with a notebook and a ballpoint pen, writing slowly and carefully.

"Ma'am, can you tell me what happened?"

The woman—her name was Patricia Harris, from Atlanta—could barely speak through her tears. "We were just—just wading. The water was so calm. Tom said—he said something about how warm it was. I looked away for a second. Maybe two seconds. And when I looked back he was gone. Under the water. He didn't shout or—or anything. He was just gone."

"Your husband was a good swimmer?"

"Yes! Tom swam in college. Every morning at the Y back home." Patricia's voice broke. "He was healthy. The doctor said he was healthy."

Deputy Collins wrote it all down. Turned to Marcus.

"You're the lifeguard?"

"Marcus Chen. I was on duty when it happened."

"You see what happened?"

Marcus tried to recall the exact sequence, but it was already blurring. "I saw them wading. They were waist-deep, maybe chest-deep. Calm water, good visibility. I looked away to scan the rest of the beach—standard procedure, scan every thirty seconds. When I looked back, Mrs. Harris was screaming and Mr. Harris was gone."

"How long between when you looked away and when you looked back?"

"Thirty seconds. Maybe forty-five."

"And you didn't see him go under? No struggle, no distress?"

"No. By the time I saw the situation, he was already submerged."

"Water conditions?"

"Perfect. Calm, warm, clear. Good swimming conditions. No rip currents, no unusual wave action." Marcus heard the defensive note creeping into his voice and tried to control it. "I've been watching this beach for three years. This shouldn't have happened."

Collins's expression was sympathetic but dismissive. "People drown, son. Even good swimmers. Could've been a cramp, could've been a heart attack, could've been he panicked for some reason. Gulf's unpredictable sometimes."

"The gulf is calm as glass."

"Still. It happens." Collins closed his notebook. "I'll file the report. Accidental drowning, most likely. Happens couple times a summer around here. Tragic, but that's life."

Marcus wanted to argue but couldn't find the words. The ambulance arrived, lights flashing but no siren. Two EMTs confirmed what everyone already knew: the man was dead. They loaded him onto a gurney with practiced efficiency, covered him with a sheet.

Patricia Harris followed them to the ambulance, moving like a sleepwalker. A tourist who'd befriended her—middle-aged woman with kind eyes—went with her, holding her hand.

The beach slowly returned to normal. Tourists drifted back to their towels. The teenage girls turned their radio back on. Life continued.

Marcus stayed on the sand, staring at the wet outline where the body had been. Carter sat down next to him.

"You did everything right," Carter said quietly.

"He's still dead."

"Yeah." Carter didn't have a response to that. They sat in silence, watching the gulf. It looked peaceful. Innocent. Like nothing had happened.

"Deputy's right, you know," Carter said after a while. "People drown. Even in calm water. Medical emergency, panic attack, anything could've—"

"I need to see the body."

Carter blinked. "What?"

"Before they take him away. I need to see him." Marcus stood up, brushing sand from his trunks. "Come with me."

The ambulance was still in the parking lot, EMTs doing paperwork before transport. Marcus approached them, Carter trailing behind.

"Hey, I'm the lifeguard. The one who tried to resuscitate him. Can I—can I see him? Just for a second?"

The older EMT, a woman with gray hair and tired eyes, looked at him with understanding. "Closure?"

"Something like that."

She nodded and opened the back of the ambulance. The body was on the gurney, sheet pulled up to the neck. The EMT pulled it down to the waist.

Marcus looked. Really looked.

Tom Harris was pale, skin waterlogged and cold. Eyes closed. Mouth slightly open. Chest still, no rise and fall of breathing. Dead.

But there was something else.

Marcus's eyes went to the ankles, visible below the edge of the man's swim trunks. Both ankles had bruising. Dark oval marks, one on each side of each ankle. Like someone had grabbed them. Hard.

"What's that?" Marcus pointed.

The EMT looked. Shrugged. "Bruising. Could be from anything. Bumped into something underwater, maybe. Or postmortem settling."

"Does that look like hand marks to you?"

She looked closer, frowning. "I mean... maybe? Could be. But could also just be contusions from hitting rocks or debris. Gulf bottom's got all kinds of stuff." She pulled the sheet back up. "Look, kid, I know this is hard. Your first death on the job?"

"First drowning."

"It never gets easier. But it wasn't your fault. You did everything you could." She closed the ambulance doors gently. "We've got to transport him now. Coroner will do the official report."

Marcus stepped back as the ambulance pulled away, gravel crunching under its tires. Carter was staring at him.

"What was that about? Hand marks?"

"His ankles. Did you see them?"

"No, I was standing back. What about them?"

Marcus looked back at the gulf, trying to make sense of what he'd seen. "There was bruising. Oval patterns, both ankles. Like grip marks."

"From what? Grabbing something underwater?"

"Or from someone grabbing him."

Carter laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Come on, man. You think someone drowned that guy? In broad daylight, in front of his wife, on a beach full of people?"

"I don't know what I think." Marcus's head was pounding, sun and adrenaline and the crash after the rescue attempt. "I just know those marks looked wrong."

"You're in shock. It's normal. Come on, let's get you some water and get you off duty for the day. I'll tell Kowalski you need a break."

Marcus let Carter lead him away, but he couldn't shake the image. Those oval bruises, dark against pale waterlogged skin. The perfect placement—both ankles, same position.

Like someone had grabbed Tom Harris's ankles from below and pulled him under.

But that was impossible. The water had been clear. Marcus had seen the bottom. There was no one else down there.

Just Tom Harris, face down, already dead.

That night, Marcus lay in Room 24, staring at the water-stained ceiling. The air conditioning rattled, struggling against the humidity. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the body. Saw those bruises.

Saw the empty water, calm and clear, hiding nothing.

Except maybe it had been hiding something. Someone.

But who could grab a man's ankles in chest-deep water, in broad daylight, and not be seen? Who could drown a grown man, a good swimmer, in perfect conditions without making a splash or attracting attention?

Nobody. It was impossible.

But the bruises were real.

Marcus finally fell into uneasy sleep somewhere after three a.m., the questions still circling in his mind. He dreamed of clear water and hands reaching up from the sand, pulling him down into turquoise darkness.

When he woke, sweating and disoriented, one thought was crystal clear:

This wasn't over.
